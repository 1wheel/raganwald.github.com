        <p>A little more than four years ago, I tried an experiment: On October 27, 2008 I pushed <a href="https://github.com/raganwald/homoiconic/blob/master/2008-10-27/unfold.markdown">some text in markdown format</a> to Github, and a new kind of bloggy thing called <a href="https://github.com/raganwald/homoiconic">Homoiconic</a> was born.</p>

<p>As a blog, it was lame. Markdown is seriously limited as a word processor. Github prevented me from doing anything interesting with layouts. A repo has terrible indexing of old posts. No comments or JavaScript to embed anything useful. I didn’t own my own domain, a serious flaw.</p>

<p>However.</p>

<h3 id="distraction-free">distraction-free</h3>

<p>You know how people have embraced this idea of “distraction-free writing?” Github gave me that, in Spades, doubled and redoubled with an overtrick. Markdown is inherently distraction-free, there’s only so much you can do with it, and if you want more you just have to say no to yourself and keep writing.</p>

<p>The workflow was a little geeky, but no worse than using SFTP or some weird proprietary blog engine web application. And it’s kind of my job to use git, so I can’t really complain about that.</p>

<p>And my world was changing. Fewer and fewer of my readers were “subscribing” to my blog via RSS. I was getting my “hits” through Reddit and Hacker News and other people’s tweets and so on. It seemed like a win to me, so I gave it a try, especially for anything code-u-macated.</p>

<h3 id="posterous">posterous</h3>

<p>A while later, Posterous launched. The best thing about Posterous was the workflow: Send an email. The worst thing about Posterous was that once you sent that email, you could format your posts with HTML and fancy styles. I tried it, loved the post-by-email, hated the fact that I would often fiddle with formatting.</p>

<p>One of the nice things about markdown is that it is what it is. There’s very little need to fiddle with anything except the actual words and ideas. Time passed, and Posterous got bought by Twitter, and now they’re shutting down. Boo hoo.</p>

<h3 id="and-now">and now…</h3>

<p>In the last twelve months or so, I’ve been embracing <a href="http://pages.github.com">Github Pages</a> for some projects. In exchange for fiddling with a domain registrar, I can host things on my own domains, like:</p>

<ul>
  <li>http://allong.es</li>
  <li>http://recursiveuniver.se</li>
  <li>http://oscin.es</li>
</ul>

<p>I’m even hosting free versions of some of my books:</p>

<ul>
  <li>http://combinators.info</li>
  <li>http://ristrettolo.gy</li>
</ul>

<p>And with those under my belt, I took the plunge and moved all of my writing from 2013 over to http://braythwayt.com. I’m now using Jekyll to publish my “bloggy thing” to Github. I get the same lame lack of ability to format my posts, but I can now waste time with layouts.</p>

<p>And I get my own domain, that’s a win. And the layouts let me do things like pimp my books on every page without doing a global search-and-replace. Or add analytics to the blog. We’ll see if I do much more than just post.</p>

<h3 id="my-workflow">my workflow</h3>

<p>http://braythwayt.com is kept in a separate github repository</p>
