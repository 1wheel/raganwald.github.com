> In number theory, a **left-truncatable prime** is a prime number which, in a given base, contains no 0, and if the leading ("left") digit is successively removed, then all resulting numbers are prime. For example, 9137, since 9137, 137, 37 and 7 are all prime. Decimal representation is often assumed.

> A **right-truncatable prime** is a prime which remains prime when the last ("right") digit is successively removed. 7393 is an example of a right-truncatable prime, since 7393, 739, 73, 7 are all prime.
