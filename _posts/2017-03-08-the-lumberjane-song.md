SINGER  
I'm a lumberjane and I'm OK  
I sleep all night and I code all day  

NERD CHOIR  
> She's a lumberjane and she's OK  
> She sleeps all night and codes all day  

I write clean code, I mentor youth  
I go to the lavatory  
On Wednesdays I race bicycles  
Mine's espresso, if you please  

> She writes clean code, mentors youth  
> She goes to the lavatory  
> On Wednesdays she races bicycles  
> Hers is espresso, if you please  

> She's a lumberjane and she's OK  
> She sleeps all night and codes all day  

I write clean code, I mentor youth  
I march against injustice  
I can't stand wearing high heels  
And play roller derby  

> She writes clean code, she mentors youths  
> She marches against injustice  
> She can't stand wearing high heels  
> And plays roller derby...?  

*(The nerds begin to look uncomfortable, but brighten up as they go into the chorus.)*

> She's a lumberjane and she's OK  
> She sleeps all night and codes all day  

I write clean code, don't give a damn  
What reddit thinks is right  
I'm taking back, my human rights  
Just like my dear mama  

> She writes clean code, doesn't give a damn  
> What reddit thinks is right???  

*(The nerd choir mumbles angrily, and the song breaks down. The singer skates off, whistling the tune cheerfully.)*
