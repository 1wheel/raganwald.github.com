> There are only two hard problems in computer science: Cache invalidation, and naming things.â€”Phil Karlton (1947-1997)

In *programming*, there are also two hard problems, but they're different hard problems. They are *managing abstraction*, and *managing pragmatism*. They are related, but not necessarily correlated.

### managing abstraction

There's a general idea that thinking styles can be associated with a continuum from "concrete" to "abstract" thinking. Vastly oversimplifying, a concrete thinker focuses on what *is*, and preferably what is *in front of them*. When a concrete thinker reads a blog post about a new technique, they like to see examples they can use right now.

Abstract thinkers, on the other hand, focus on patterns and generalizations.
