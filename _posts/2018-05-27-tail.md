In [Recursion? We don't need no stinking recursion!](http://raganwald.com/2018/05/20/we-dont-need-no-stinking-recursion.html), we looked at seven different techniques for turning recursive functions into iterative functions. In this post, we're going to take a deeper look at technique #3, [convert recursion to iteration with tail calls](http://raganwald.com/2018/05/20/we-dont-need-no-stinking-recursion.html#3-convert-recursion-to-iteration-with-tail-calls).

Before we dive into it, here's a quick recap of what we explored in the previous post:

### recursion, see recursion

The shallow definition of a recursive algorithm is a function that directly or indirectly calls itself. For example, the [factorial]

> In mathematics, the factorial of a non-negative integer *n*, denoted by *n*!, is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to *n*. For example,
>
> 5! = 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120.
>
> The value of 0! is 1, according to the convention for an empty product.[1]
