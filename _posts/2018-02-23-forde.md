This is _Forde’s Tenth Rule_:

> “Any sufficiently complicated model class contains an ad-hoc, informally-specified, bug-ridden, slow implementation of half of a State Machine.”

Forde's Tenth Rule is named after Pete Forde, who may or may not have said those exact words, and may or may not have nine other rules. But he definitely pointed out that most domain models are best represented as state machines, and if we don't build them that way from the start, we end up with difficult-to-understand and difficult-to-maintain accretions of incomplete state machine functionality.
