> “Any sufficiently complicated model class contains an ad-hoc, informally-specified, bug-ridden, slow implementation of half of a State Machine.”

_Forde's Tenth Rule_ is named after Pete Forde, who may or may not have said those exact words, and may or may not have nine other rules.

But Pete definitely pointed out that most domain models are best represented as state machines, and if we don't build them that way from the start, we end up with difficult-to-understand and difficult-to-maintain accretions of incomplete state machine functionality. Building models, especially domain models, as state machines from the start allows us to tame complexity and more easily map requirements to functionality.

So, what is a State Machine? And how does it help?

### finite state machines

> A [finite state machines][fsm], or simply a _state machine_, is a mathematical model of computation. It is an abstract machine that can be in exactly one of a finite number of states at any given time. The FSM can change from one state to another in response to some external inputs; the change from one state to another is called a transition. An FSM is defined by a list of its states, its initial state, and the conditions for each transition.--[Wikipedia][fsm]

[fsm]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite-state_machine

Well, that's a mouthful. To put it in context from a programming (as opposed to idealized model of computation) point of view, when we program with objects, we build little machines. They have internal state and respond to messages or events from the rest of the program via the mechanism of their methods. (JavaScript also permist direct acesss to properties, but let's consider the subset of programs that only interact with objects via methods.)

Most objects are designed to encapsulate some kind of state. Stateless objects are certainly a thing, but let's put them aside and consider only objects that have state. Some such objects can be considered State Machines, some cannot. What distinguishes them?

**First, a state machine has a notion of a _state_.** All stateful objects have some kind of "state," but a state machine reifies this and gives it a name. Furthermore, there are a finite number of possible states that a state machine can be in, and it is always in exactly one of these states.

For example let's say that a bank account has a balance and it can be be one of `open`, `closed`, or `frozen`. Its balance certainly is stateful, but it's "state" from the perspective of a state machine is `open`, `closed`, or `frozen`.

**Second, a state machine formally defines a starting state, and allowable transitions between states**. The aforementioned bank account starts in `open` state. It can transition from `open` to `closed`, and from time to time, from `closed` back to `open`. This can be displayed witha graph, and such hgraphs are a helpful way to document or brainstorm behaviour:

![Bank account with Open and Closed states](/assets/images/state-machine/account-open-closed.jpg)

**Third, a state machine transitions between states in reponse to events**. Our bank account starts in `open` state. When `open`, a bank account responds to a `close` event by transitioning to the `closed` state. When `closed`, a bank account responds to the `reopen` event by transitioning to the `open` state.

### transitions

The events that trigger transitions are often noted by labeling the transitions on the graph:

![Bank account with events](/assets/images/state-machine/account-events.jpg)

We now have enough to create a naïve JavaScript object to represent what we know so far about a bank account. We will make each event a method, and the state will be a string. We'll elide the primary responsibility of each method and just handle the implementation of states and transitions:

```javascript
let account = {
  state: 'open',

  close () {
    if (this.state === 'open') {
      if (balance > 0) {
        // ...transfer balance to suspension account
      }
      this.state = 'closed';
    } else {
      throw 'invalid event';
    }
  },

  reopen () {
    if (this.state === 'closed') {
      // ...restore balance if applicable
      this.state = 'open';
    } else {
      throw 'invalid event';
    }
  }
}

account.state
  //=> open

account.close();
account.state
  //=> closed
```

The first thing we observe is that our bank account handles different events in different states. In the `open` state, it only handles the `close` event. In the `closed` state, it only handles the `reopen` event. The natural way of implementing events is as methods on the object, but now we are imbedding in each method a responsibility for knowing what state the account is in and whether that transition can be allowed or not.

It's also not clear from the code what all the possible states are, or how we transition. What is clear is what each method does, in isolation. This is one of the "affordances" of a typical obeject-wth-methods design: It makes it very easy to see what an individual method does, but not to get a higher view of how the methdos are elated to each other.

---

Let's add a little functionality:

Accounts aren't much good without money: So we'll add two events, `deposit` and `withdraw`. They are only allowed on open accounts, and they do not change its state. This is normally shown in the graph as a transition from a state back to itself:

![Bank account with events and self](/assets/images/state-machine/account-events-withself.jpg)

We can implement these methods, and add some naïve code to maintain the balance. But wait While we are coding this, a new requirement comes in: Accounts can be placed `on hold`. Accounts on hold can accept deposits, but not withdrawals.

The new graph looks like this:

![Bank account with events and self and hold](/assets/images/state-machine/account-events-withself-held.jpg)

And the code we end up with looks like this:

```javascript
let account = {
  state: 'open',
  balance: 0,

  deposit (amount) {
    if (this.state === 'open') {
      this.balance = this.balance + amount;
    } else if (this.state === 'held') {
      this.balance = this.balance + amount;
    } else {
      throw 'invalid event';
    }
  },

  withdraw (amount) {
    if (this.state === 'open') {
      this.balance = this.balance - amount;
    } else {
      throw 'invalid event';
    }
  },

  placeHold () {
    if (this.state === 'open') {
      this.state = 'held';
    } else {
      throw 'invalid event';
    }
  },

  removeHold () {
    if (this.state === 'held') {
      this.state = 'open';
    } else {
      throw 'invalid event';
    }
  },

  close () {
    if (this.state === 'open') {
      if (balance > 0) {
        // ...transfer balance to suspension account
      }
      this.state = 'closed';
    }
    if (this.state === 'held') {
      if (balance > 0) {
        // ...transfer balance to suspension account
      }
      this.state = 'closed';
    } else {
      throw 'invalid event';
    }
  },

  reopen () {
    if (this.state === 'open') {
      throw 'invalid event';
    } else if (this.state === 'closed') {
      // ...restore balance if applicable
      this.state = 'open';
    }
  }
}
```

It is hard to see from this how accounts behave in each state, which is why notations like state diagrams are used. But the problem with documentation like a state diagram is that it's not executable or testable, therefore it is not guaranteed to reflect the latest changes to the code.

What to do?

### executable state descriptions

Directly compiling disagrams has been--so far--highly unproductive for programming. But there's another representation of a state machine that can prove helpful: A **transition table**. Here's our transition table for the naïve bank account:

|            | open               | held       | closed |
|:-----------|:-------------------|:-----------|:-------|
| **open**   | desposit, withdraw | place-hold | close  |
| **held**   | remove-hold        | deposit    | close  |
| **closed** | reopen             |            |        |

In the column, we have the current state of the account. Each subsequent column is a destination state. At the intersection of the current state and a destination state, we have the event or events that transition the object from current to destination state. Thus, `deosit` and `withdraw` transition from `open` to `open`, while `place-hold` transitions the object from `open` to `held`. The start state is arbitrarily taken as the first state listed.

Like the state graph, the transition table shows clearly which events are handled by which state, and the transitions.

We could encode the transition table with JavaScript objects:

```javascript
const transitionTable = {
  open: {
    open: ['desposit', 'withdraw'],
    held: ['placeHold'],
    closed: ['close']
  },

  held: {
    open: ['removeHold'],
    held: ['deposit'],
    closed: ['close']
  },

  closed: {
    open: ['reopen']
  }
};
```

But what about the code we wish to implement? Here's a version of the table with named function expressions implementing code instead of strings naming the events:

```javascript
const transitionTable = {
  open: {
    open: {
      deposit (amount) { this.balance = this.balance + amount; },
      withdraw (amount) { this.balance = this.balance - amount; },
    },
    held: {
      placeHold () {}
    },
    closed: {
      close () {
        if (balance > 0) {
          // ...transfer balance to suspension account
        }
      }
    }
  },

  held: {
    open: {
      removeHold () {}
    },
    held: {
      deposit (amount) { this.balance = this.balance + amount; }
    },
    closed: {
      close () {
        if (balance > 0) {
          // ...transfer balance to suspension account
        }
      }
    }
  },

  closed: {
    open: {
      reopen () {
        // ...restore balance if applicable
      }
    }
  }
};
```

This doesn't "work" yet, but we can see that it emphasizes the transitions between the states, and lets us quickly see which actions lead to which changes in states. Let's add a little implementation structure to it:

```javascript
const STATE = Symbol("state");
const STATES = Symbol("states");
const STARTING_STATE = Symbol("starting-state");

const Account = {
  balance: 0,
  STARTING_STATE: 'open',
  STATES: {
    open: {
      open: {
        deposit (amount) { this.balance = this.balance + amount; },
        withdraw (amount) { this.balance = this.balance - amount; },
      },
      held: {
        placeHold () {}
      },
      closed: {
        close () {
          if (balance > 0) {
            // ...transfer balance to suspension account
          }
        }
      }
    },

    held: {
      open: {
        removeHold () {}
      },
      held: {
        deposit (amount) { this.balance = this.balance + amount; }
      },
      closed: {
        close () {
          if (balance > 0) {
            // ...transfer balance to suspension account
          }
        }
      }
    },

    closed: {
      open: {
        reopen () {
          // ...restore balance if applicable
        }
      }
    }
  }
};
```

This description isn't executable, but it doesn't take much to write an imlementation organized along the same lines:

---

### implementing a state machine that matches our description

In [Mixins, Forwarding, and Delegation in JavaScript][mixins], we briefly touched on using late-bound delegation to create state machines. The principle is that instead of using strings for state, we'll use objects that contain the methods we're interested in. First, we'll write out what those objects will look like:

[mixins]: http://raganwald.com/2014/04/10/mixins-forwarding-delegation.html

```javascript
const STATE = Symbol("state");
const STATES = Symbol("states");

const open = {
  deposit (amount) { this.balance = this.balance + amount; },
  withdraw (amount) { this.balance = this.balance - amount; },
  placeHold () {
    this[STATE] = this[STATES].held;
  },
  close () {
    if (balance > 0) {
      // ...transfer balance to suspension account
    }
    this[STATE] = this[STATES].closed;
  }
};

const held = {
  removeHold () {
    this[STATE] = this[STATES].open;
  },
  deposit (amount) { this.balance = this.balance + amount; },
  close () {
    if (balance > 0) {
      // ...transfer balance to suspension account
    }
    this[STATE] = this[STATES].closed;
  }
};

const closed = {
  reopen () {
    // ...restore balance if applicable
    this[STATE] = this[STATES].open;
  }
};
```

Now our actual account object stores a state object rather than a state string, and delegates all methods to it. When an event is invalid, we'll get an exception. That can be "fixed," but let's not worry about it now:

```javascript
const account = {
  balance: 0,

  [STATE]: open,
  [STATES]: { open, held, closed },

  deposit (...args) { return this[STATE].deposit.apply(this, args); },
  withdraw (...args) { return this[STATE].withdraw.apply(this, args); },
  close (...args) { return this[STATE].close.apply(this, args); },
  placeHold (...args) { return this[STATE].placeHold.apply(this, args); },
  removeHold (...args) { return this[STATE].removeHold.apply(this, args); },
  reopen (...args) { return this[STATE].reopen.apply(this, args); }
};
```

Let's make one quick improvement: We're littering the methods with state assignments. Let's write a [decorator] to do it. At this moment, syntactic sugar for decorators are not yet fully accepted as a JavaScript standard. In ES2015, we could write a `TRANSITION_TO` decorator as a function for all event handlers that transition to a different state:

[decorator]: https://tc39.github.io/proposal-decorators/

```javascript
const STATE = Symbol("state");
const STATES = Symbol("states");

function TRANSITION_TO (stateName, fn) {
  return function (...args) {
    const returnValue = fn.apply(this, args);
    this[STATE] = this[STATES][stateName];
    return returnValue;
  };
}

const open = {
  deposit (amount) { this.balance = this.balance + amount; },
  withdraw (amount) { this.balance = this.balance - amount; },
  placeHold: TRANSITION_TO('held', () => undefined),
  close: TRANSITION_TO('closed', function () {
    if (balance > 0) {
      // ...transfer balance to suspension account
    }
  })
};

const held = {
  removeHold: TRANSITION_TO('open', () => undefined),
  deposit (amount) { this.balance = this.balance + amount; },
  close: TRANSITION_TO('closed', function () {
    if (balance > 0) {
      // ...transfer balance to suspension account
    }
  })
};

const closed = {
  reopen: TRANSITION_TO('open', function () {
    // ...restore balance if applicable
  })
};

const account = {
  balance: 0,

  [STATE]: open,
  [STATES]: { open, held, closed },

  deposit (...args) { return this[STATE].deposit.apply(this, args); },
  withdraw (...args) { return this[STATE].withdraw.apply(this, args); },
  close (...args) { return this[STATE].close.apply(this, args); },
  placeHold (...args) { return this[STATE].placeHold.apply(this, args); },
  removeHold (...args) { return this[STATE].removeHold.apply(this, args); },
  reopen (...args) { return this[STATE].reopen.apply(this, args); }
};
```

We could stop right here if we wanted to: This is a pattern that is remarkably easy to write by hand, and for many cases, it is far easier to read and maintain than having various `if` and/or `switch`` statements littering every method.

But since we're enjoying ourselves, what would it take to automate the process of implementing this naïve state machine pattern from descriptions?

### compiling descriptions into state machines

The first thing we'll do is "begin with the end in mind." We wish to write something like this:

```javascript
const STATES = Symbol("states");
const STARTING_STATE = Symbol("starting-state");

function TRANSITION_TO (stateName, fn) {
  return function (...args) {
    const returnValue = fn.apply(this, args);
    this[STATE] = this[STATES][stateName];
    return returnValue;
  };
}

const account = StateMachine({
  balance: 0,

  [STARTING_STATE]: 'open',
  [STATES]: {
    open: {
      deposit (amount) { this.balance = this.balance + amount; },
      withdraw (amount) { this.balance = this.balance - amount; },
      placeHold: TRANSITIONS_TO('held', () => undefined),
      close: TRANSITIONS_TO('closed', function () {
        if (balance > 0) {
          // ...transfer balance to suspension account
        }
      })
    },
    held: {
      removeHold: TRANSITIONS_TO('open', () => undefined),
      deposit (amount) { this.balance = this.balance + amount; },
      close: TRANSITIONS_TO('closed', function () {
        if (balance > 0) {
          // ...transfer balance to suspension account
        }
      })
    },
    closed: {
      reopen: TRANSITIONS_TO('open', function () {
        // ...restore balance if applicable
      })
    }
  }
});
```

What does `StateMachine` do?

```javascript
const RESERVED = [STARTING_STATE, STATES];

function StateMachine (description) {
  const machine = {};

  // Handle all the initial states and/or methods
  const propertiesAndMethods = Object.keys(description).filter(property => !RESERVED.includes(property));
  for (const property of propertiesAndMethods) {
    machine[property] = description[property];
  }

  // now its states
  machine[STATES] = description[STATES];

  // what event handlers does it have?
  const eventNames = Object.entries(description[STATES]).reduce(
    (eventNames, [state, stateDescription]) => {
      const eventNamesForThisState = Object.keys(stateDescription);

      for (const eventName of eventNamesForThisState) {
        eventNames.add(eventName);
      }
      return eventNames;
      },
    new Set()
  );

  // definine the delegating methods
  for (const eventName of eventNames) {
    machine[eventName] = function (...args) {
      { return this[STATE][eventName].apply(this, args); }
    }
  }

  // set the starting state
  machine[STATE] = description[STATES][description[STARTING_STATE]];

  // we're done
  return machine;
}
```
