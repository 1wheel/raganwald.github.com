In JavaScript, functions are *first-class entities*. meaning, you can store them in data structures, pass them to other functions, and return them from functions. An amazing number of very strong programming techniques arise as a consequence of functions-as-first-class-entities. One of the strongest is also one of the simplest: You can write functions that compose and transform other functions.

### a very, very, very basic introduction to decorators

Let's consider logical negation. We might have a function like this:

{% highlight javascript %}
const isaFruit = (f) =>
  f === 'apple' || f === 'banana' || f === 'orange';

isaFruit('orange')
  //=> true
{% endhighlight %}

We can use it to pick fruit from a basket, using an array's `.filter` method:

{% highlight javascript %}
['pecan', 'apple', 'chocolate', 'cracker', 'orange'].filter(isaFruit)
  //=> ["apple","orange"]
{% endhighlight %}

What if we want the things-that-are-not-fruit? There are a few solutions. Languages like Smalltalk and Ruby have a style where collections provide a `.reject` method. Or we could write a `notaFruit` function:

{% highlight javascript %}
const notaFruit = (f) =>
  f !== 'apple' && f !== 'banana' && f !== 'orange';

['pecan', 'apple', 'chocolate', 'cracker', 'orange'].filter(notaFruit)
  //=> ["pecan","chocolate","cracker"]
{% endhighlight %}

We could also take advantage of function expressions and inline the logical negation of `isaFruit`:

{% highlight javascript %}
['pecan', 'apple', 'chocolate', 'cracker', 'orange'].filter(it => !isaFruit(it));
  //=> ["pecan","chocolate","cracker"]
{% endhighlight %}

That is interesting. It's a pattern we can repeat to find things in the basket that don't start with "c:"

{% highlight javascript %}
const startsWithC = (f) =>
  f[0] === 'c' || f[0] === 'C';

['pecan', 'apple', 'chocolate', 'cracker', 'orange'].filter(it => !startsWithC(it))
  //=> ["pecan","apple","orange"]
{% endhighlight %}

We can take advantage of functions-as-first-class-entities to turn this pattern into a function that modifies another function. We can use that to name another function, or even use it inline as an expression:

{% highlight javascript %}
const not = (fn) =>
  (...args) =>
    !(fn(...args))
    
const anotherNotaFruit = not(isaFruit);

anotherNotaFruit("pecan")
  //=> true

['pecan', 'apple', 'chocolate', 'cracker', 'orange'].filter(not(startsWithC))
  //=> ["pecan","apple","orange"]
{% endhighlight %}

`not` is a *decorator*, a function that takes another function and "decorates it" with new functionality that is semantically related to the original function's behaviour. This allows us to use `not(isaFruit)` anywhere we could use `isaFuit`, or use `not(startsWithC)` anywhere we can use `startsWithC`.

`not` is so trivial that it doesn't feel like it wins us much, but the exact same principle allows us to write decorators like:

{% highlight javascript %}
const maybe = (fn) =>
  (...args) => {
    for (let arg of args) {
      if (arg == null) return arg;
    }
    return fn(...args);
  }
    
[1, null, 3, 4, null, 6, 7].map(maybe(x => x * x))
  //=> [1,null,9,16,null,36,49]
{% endhighlight %}

You'll find lots of other decorators swanning about in [books about using functions in JavaScript](https://leanpub.com/javascriptallongesix "Shameless plug for the author's book"). And your favourite JavaScript library is probably loaded with decorators that memoize the result of an idempotent function, or debounce functions that you may use to call a server from a browser.

### what makes decorators possible?

On the surface, decorators are made possible by the fact that functions are first-class entities, therefore we can pass a function to a decorator, and return another function that invoked the first function. But there's something else: The fact that all functions are called in the exact same way.

Imagine, if you will, that functions came in two colours:[^colours] <span style="color: red;">red</span> and <span style="color: blue;">blue</span>. Now imagine that when we invoke a function in a variable, we type the 

[^colours]: This metaphor is merrily snarfed from [What colour is your function?](http://journal.stuffwithstuff.com/2015/02/01/what-color-is-your-function/)
