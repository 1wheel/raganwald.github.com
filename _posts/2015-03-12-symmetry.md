In JavaScript, functions are *first-class entities*. meaning, you can store them in data structures, pass them to other functions, and return them from functions. An amazing number of very strong programming techniques arise as a consequence of functions-as-first-class-entities. One of the strongest is also one of the simplest: You can write functions that compose and transform other functions.

### a very, very, very basic introduction to decorators

Let's consider logical negation. We might have a function like this:

{% highlight javascript %}
const isaFruit = (f) =>
  f === 'apple' || f === 'banana' || f === 'orange';

isaFruit('orange')
  //=> true
{% endhighlight %}

We can use it to pick fruit from a basket, using an array's `.filter` method:

{% highlight javascript %}
['pecan', 'apple', 'chocolate', 'cracker', 'orange'].filter(isaFruit)
  //=> ["apple","orange"]
{% endhighlight %}

What if we want the things-that-are-not-fruit? There are a few solutions. Languages like Smalltalk and Ruby have a style where collections provide a `.reject` method. Or we could write a `notaFruit` function:

{% highlight javascript %}
const notaFruit = (f) =>
  f !== 'apple' && f !== 'banana' && f !== 'orange';

['pecan', 'apple', 'chocolate', 'cracker', 'orange'].filter(notaFruit)
  //=> ["pecan","chocolate","cracker"]
{% endhighlight %}

We could also take advantage of function expressions and inline the logical negation of `isaFruit`:

{% highlight javascript %}
['pecan', 'apple', 'chocolate', 'cracker', 'orange'].filter(it => !isaFruit(it));
  //=> ["pecan","chocolate","cracker"]
{% endhighlight %}

That is interesting. It's a pattern we can repeat to find things in the basket that don't start with "c:"

{% highlight javascript %}
const startsWithC = (f) =>
  f[0] === 'c' || f[0] === 'C';

['pecan', 'apple', 'chocolate', 'cracker', 'orange'].filter(it => !startsWithC(it))
  //=> ["pecan","apple","orange"]
{% endhighlight %}

We can take advantage of functions-as-first-class-entities to turn this pattern into a function that modifies another function. We can use that to name another function, or even use it inline as an expression:

{% highlight javascript %}
const not = (fn) =>
  (...args) =>
    !(fn(...args))
    
const anotherNotaFruit = not(isaFruit);

anotherNotaFruit("pecan")
  //=> true

['pecan', 'apple', 'chocolate', 'cracker', 'orange'].filter(not(startsWithC))
  //=> ["pecan","apple","orange"]
{% endhighlight %}

`not` is a *decorator*, a function that takes another function and "decorates it" with new functionality that is semantically related to the original function's behaviour. This allows us to use `not(isaFruit)` anywhere we could use `isaFuit`, or use `not(startsWithC)` anywhere we can use `startsWithC`.

`not` is so trivial that it doesn't feel like it wins us much, but the exact same principle allows us to write decorators like:

{% highlight javascript %}
const maybe = (fn) =>
  (...args) => {
    for (let arg of args) {
      if (arg == null) return arg;
    }
    return fn(...args);
  }
    
[1, null, 3, 4, null, 6, 7].map(maybe(x => x * x))
  //=> [1,null,9,16,null,36,49]
{% endhighlight %}

You'll find lots of other decorators swanning about in [books about using functions in JavaScript](https://leanpub.com/javascriptallongesix "Shameless plug for the author's book"). And your favourite JavaScript library is probably loaded with decorators that memoize the result of an idempotent function, or debounce functions that you may use to call a server from a browser.

### what makes decorators possible?

On the surface, decorators are made possible by the fact that functions are first-class entities, therefore we can pass a function to a decorator, and return another function that invoked the first function. But there's something else: The fact that all functions are called in the exact same way.

### what could make decorators difficult?

Imagine, if you will, that functions came in two colours: <span style="color: red;">red</span> and <span style="color: blue;">blue</span>. Now imagine that when we invoke a function in a variable, we type the name of the function in the proper colour. So if we write <code>const <span style="color: red;">square</span> = (x) => x * x</code>, we later have to write <code>[1, 2, 3, 4, 5].map(<span style="color: red;">square</span>)</code>. If we write <code>[1, 2, 3, 4, 5].map(<span style="color: blue;">square</span>)</code>, it won't work because `square` is a <span style="color: red;">red</span> function.

If functions worked like that, decorators would be very messy. We'd have to make colour-coded decorators, like <code><span style="color: red;">maybe</span></code> and <code><span style="color: blue;">maybe</span></code>. We'd have to carefully track which functions have which colours, much as in gendered languages like French, you need to know the gender of all inanimate objects so that you can use the correct gendered grammar when talking about them.

This sounds bad, and it is. The general principle is, if you can fewer kinds of similar things, but allow the things you do have to combine in flexible ways, you have a better design. You can't just remove things, you have to also make it very easy to combine things. Functions as first-class-entities are a good example of this, because they allow you to combine functions in flexible ways.

Coloured functions would be an example of how not to do it, because you'd be making it harder to combine functions by balkanizing them.[^colours]

[^colours]: Bob Nystrom introduced me to this excellent metaphor in [What colour is your function?](http://journal.stuffwithstuff.com/2015/02/01/what-color-is-your-function/)

### what does make decorators difficult?

Functions don't have colours in JavaScript. But there are things that have this kind of asymmetry that make things just as awkward. For example, methods in JavaScript are functions. But, when you invoke them , you have to get `this` set up correctly with `.call` or `.apply`. So while `maybe` for functions looks like this:

{% highlight javascript %}
const maybe = (fn) =>
  (...args) => {
    for (let arg of args) {
      if (arg == null) return arg;
    }
    return fn(...args);
  }
{% endhighlight %}

`maybe` for methods looks like this:

{% highlight javascript %}
const maybe = (method) =>
  function (...args) {
    for (let arg of args) {
      if (arg == null) return arg;
    }
    return method.apply(this, args);
  }
{% endhighlight %}

In JavaScript, ordinary function invocation with `(` and `)` is <span style="color: red;">red</span>, but method invocation is <span style="color: purple;">purple</span>. Browser event handling is also purple, but what makes this somewhat tolerable is that purple handling also works for red functions. But you have to be aware that some functions are purple, because if you write a "red" program, you could be happy with red decorators for years and then suddenly something breaks when a "purple" function or method is introduced.

Anything else? Oh yes there is. Constructors. EcmaScript-6 classes, and the equivalent EcmaScript-5 patterns rely on creating new objects with the `new` keyword:

{% highlight javascript %}
class Circle {
  initialize (radius) {
    this.radius = radius;
  }
}

const round = new Circle(1);
{% endhighlight %}

That `new` keyword introduces another colour, <span style="color: yellow;">yellow</span>. We can't make new circles using <span style="color: red;">red</span> function calls:

{% highlight javascript %}
const round2 = Circle(2);
  //=> Cannot call a class as a function
  
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5].map(Circle)
  //=> Cannot call a class as a function
{% endhighlight %}

And we certainly can't use a red or purple decorator on them:

{% highlight javascript %}
const MaybeCircle = maybe(Circle);

const round3 = new MaybeCircle(3);
  //=> Cannot call a class as a function
{% endhighlight %}

We can eliminate this new <span style="color: yellow;">yellow</span> kind of function by using `Object.create`. And this is why so many experienced developers dislike `new`. But once again, we'd have to use extreme discipline for fear that accidentally introducing some yellow would break our carefully crafted application.

There's yet another "colour" of function call. If you are a mathematician, this is a map:

{% highlight javascript %}
['Bob', 'Carol', 'Ted', 'Alice']
{% endhighlight %}

It maps the numbers `0`, `1`, `2`, and `3` to the names 'Bob', 'Carol', 'Ted', and 'Alice'.
