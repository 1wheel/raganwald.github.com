*"This is all very interesting," said Maude, "And I think I see where you are going with Hackenstrings. I wouldn't have grasped it without some context, but knowing that you're using Hackenstrings to explain Horton's flocks, I'm guessing that a Hackenstring game is another way of expressing the numbers that proper flocks can express."*

*"And they seem easier to work with than flocks with their birds that know sets of birds they outrank or are outranked by. Nevertheless, I fail to see what Hackenstring games make--as you put it--easy that ordinary arithmetic cannot handle."*

*Zee Hackenbush Bird waggled his eyebrows and stalked back and forth theatrically. "You have grasped the essential points. We could carry on to discuss arithmetic in Hackenstrings. Compared to the system arboreal primates use, it has several advantages. As my old professor The Walker Bird has said, the concept of addition is natural, consisting merely of laying out adjacent rows; negation, and hence subtraction, is natural, consisting of swapping the ownership of each pebble."*

*"But I think the most exciting thing that Hackenstrings make easy require us to take a little leave of our senses."*

Zee Hackenbush Bird led them over closer to the river, where a series of Hackenstring games were laid out. Beside each game were huge piles of spare pebbles. "Notice," he pointed out, "The addition of the flat rock to these games."
