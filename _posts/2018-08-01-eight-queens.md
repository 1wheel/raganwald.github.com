### preamble

In the nineteen-seventies, I spent a lot of time in Toronto's libraries. My favourite hangouts were the Sanderson Branch (which was near my home in Little Italy), and the "Spaced Out Library," a non-circulating collection of science fiction and fantasy that had been donated by [Judith Merril] and was housed within St. George and College Street branch.

I especially enjoyed reading back issues of Scientific American, and like many, I was captivated by [Martin Gardner's][mg] "Mathematical Games" columns. My mother had sent me to a day camp for gifted kids once, and it was organized like a university. The "students" self-selected electives, and I picked one called "Whodunnit." It turned out to be a half-day exercise in puzzles and games, and I was hooked.

Where else would I learn about playing tic-tac-toe in a hypercube? Or about liars and truth-tellers? Or, as it happened, about Martin Gardner? I suspect the entire material was lifted from his collections of columns, and that suited me down to the ground.

One day we had a field trip to the University of Toronto's High-Speed Job Stream, located in the [Sanford Fleming Building][^sfb]. This was a big room that had a line printer on one side of it, a punch card reader on the other, and lots and lots of stations for punching your own cards.

[^sfb]: There's a nice history of the Sanford Fleming Building on [Skulepedia](http://skulepedia.ca/wiki/Sandford_Fleming_Building), including an account of an infamous fire that engulfed the building in the Spring of 1977.

To run a job, you typed out your program, one line per card, and then stuck a header on the front that told the batch job what kind of interpreter or compiler to use. Those cards were brightly coloured, and had words like "WATFIV" or "SNOBOL" printed on them in huge letters.

You put header plus program into the hopper at the back, waited, and when it emerged from the reader, collected your punch cards and headed over to the large and noisy line printer. When the IBM 360 got around to actually running your job, it would print the results for you, and you would head over to a table to review the output and--nearly all of the time for me--find the typo or bug, update your program, and start all over again.

You can see equipment like this in any computer museum, so I won't go into much more detail. Besides, the mechanics of running programs as batch jobs was not the interesting thing about the High Speed Job Stream. *The interesting thing about the High Speed Job Stream was that there was no restriction on running jobs*. You didn't need an account or a password. Nobody stood at the door asking for proof that you were an Undergrad working on an assignment.

So I'd go over there on a summer day and write software, and sometimes, I'd try to write programs to solve puzzles.

### school

In the autumn of 1976, I packed my bags and went to [St. Andrew's College][sac], a boarding school. One of the amazing things about "SAC" was that they had an actual minicomputer on the campus. For the time, this was unprecedented. In Ontario's public school system, it was possible to take courses in programming, but they nearly all involved writing programs by filling in "bubble cards" with a pencil and submitting jobs overnight.

[sac]: https://sac.on.ca

At SAC, there was a [Nova 1220 minicomputer][1220] in a room with--oh glorious day--four ancient teletype machines hooked up to it with what I now presume were serial ports. It had various operating modes that were set by loading a 5MB removable hard disk (It was a 12" or 16" platter encased in a big protective plastic shell), and rebooting the machine by toggling bootstrap instructions into the front panel.

[1220]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_General_Nova

The mode set up for student use was a four-user BASIC interpreter. It had 16KB of RAM (yes, you read that right), and its simple model partitioned the memory so that each user got 4KB to themselves. You could type your program into the teletype, and its output would print on a roll of paper.

Saving programs on disc was not allowed. The teletypes had paper tape interfaces on the side, so to save a program we would `LIST` the source with the paper tape on, and it would punch ASCII or EBDIC codes onto the tape. We'd tear it off and take it with us. Later, to reload a program, we'd feed the tape into the teletype and it would act as if we were typing the program anew.

4KB was enough for assignments like writing a simple bubble sort, but I had discovered [David Ahl] by this time, and programs like "Super Star Trek" did not fit in 4KB. There was a 16KB single-user disc locked in a cabinet alongside programs for tabulating student results.

[David Ahl]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_H._Ahl

I was a morally vacant vessel at that point in my life, so I would go in late, pick the lock, and boot up single-user mode, in defiance of all regulation. I could then work on customizing Super Star Trek or write programs to solve puzzles. Curiously, I never tampered with the student records. I'm not going to tell you that I had a moral code about these things. I think the truth is that I just didn't care about marks.

Now about puzzles. One of the things I worked on was writing new games. I made a [Maharajah and the Sepoys][ms] program that would play the Maharajah while I played the standard chess pieces. It could beat me, which was enough AI for my purposes. This got me thinking about something I'd read in a Martin Gardner book, the [Eight Queens Puzzle][8q].

[ms]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maharajah_and_the_Sepoys

I decided to write a program to search for the solutions by brute force.

### The Eight Queens Puzzle

As Wikipedia explains, "The [**eight queens puzzle**][8q] is the problem of placing eight chess queens on an 8Ã—8 chessboard so that no two queens threaten each other. Thus, a solution requires that no two queens share the same row, column, or diagonal."

By this time I knew a little about writing "generate and test" algorithms, as well as a little about depth-first search from writing games (like "Maharajah and the Sepoys") that performed basic [minimax] searches for moves to make. So I set about writing a BASIC program to search for solutions. I had no real understanding of computational complexity and running time, but what if I wrote a program and left it running all night?

[minimax]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimax

The truly brute force solution looks something like this (BASIC has a `for... next` construct, but close enough):

```javascript
test: for (let i0 = 0; i0 < 8; ++i0) {
       for (let j0 = 0; j0 < 8; ++j0) {
         for (let i1 = 0; i1 < 8; ++i1) {
           for (let j1 = 0; j1 < 8; ++j1) {
             for (let i2 = 0; i2 < 8; ++i2) {
               for (let j2 = 0; j2 < 8; ++j2) {
                 for (let i3 = 0; i3 < 8; ++i3) {
                   for (let j3 = 0; j3 < 8; ++j3) {
                     for (let i4 = 0; i4 < 8; ++i4) {
                       for (let j4 = 0; j4 < 8; ++j4) {
                         for (let i5 = 0; i5 < 8; ++i5) {
                           for (let j5 = 0; j5 < 8; ++j5) {
                             for (let i6 = 0; i6 < 8; ++i6) {
                               for (let j6 = 0; j6 < 8; ++j6) {
                                 for (let i7 = 0; i7 < 8; ++i7) {
                                   for (let j7 = 0; j7 < 8; ++j7) {
                                     const queens = [
                                       [i0, j0],
                                       [i1, j1],
                                       [i2, j2],
                                       [i3, j3],
                                       [i4, j4],
                                       [i5, j5],
                                       [i6, j6],
                                       [i7, j7]
                                     ];

                                     if (test(queens)) {
                                       console.log(stringify(queens));
                                       break test;
                                     }
                                   }
                                 }
                               }
                             }
                           }
                         }
                       }
                     }
                   }
                 }
               }
             }
           }
         }
       }
    }

function test (queens) {
  const board = [
    [".", ".", ".", ".", ".", ".", ".", "."],
    [".", ".", ".", ".", ".", ".", ".", "."],
    [".", ".", ".", ".", ".", ".", ".", "."],
    [".", ".", ".", ".", ".", ".", ".", "."],
    [".", ".", ".", ".", ".", ".", ".", "."],
    [".", ".", ".", ".", ".", ".", ".", "."],
    [".", ".", ".", ".", ".", ".", ".", "."],
    [".", ".", ".", ".", ".", ".", ".", "."]
  ];

  for (const [i, j] of queens) {
    if (board[i][j] != '.') {
      // square is occupied or threatened
      return false;
    }

    for (let k = 0; k < 7; ++k) {
      // fill row and column
      board[i][k] = board[k][j] = "x";

      const vOffset = k-i;
      const hDiagonal1 = j + vOffset;
      const hDiagonal2 = j + vOffset;

      // fill diagonals
      if (hDiagonal1 >= 0 && hDiagonal1 <= 7) {
        board[k][hDiagonal1] = "x";
      }

      if (hDiagonal2 >= 0 && hDiagonal2 <= 7) {
        board[k][hDiagonal2] = "x";
      }
    }
  }

  return board;
}

function stringify (queens) {
  const board = [
    [".", ".", ".", ".", ".", ".", ".", "."],
    [".", ".", ".", ".", ".", ".", ".", "."],
    [".", ".", ".", ".", ".", ".", ".", "."],
    [".", ".", ".", ".", ".", ".", ".", "."],
    [".", ".", ".", ".", ".", ".", ".", "."],
    [".", ".", ".", ".", ".", ".", ".", "."],
    [".", ".", ".", ".", ".", ".", ".", "."],
    [".", ".", ".", ".", ".", ".", ".", "."]
  ];

  for (const [i, j] of queens) {
    board[i][j] = "Q";
  }

  return board.map(row => row.join('')).join("\n");
}
```

I believe I tried that, left the program running overnight, and when I came in the next morning before school it was still running. It was searching `64^8` candidates for a solution, and a huge part of its running time is the excruciating slowness of the test algorithm

IIRC, I had an insight of sorts: If I could arrange an _ordering_ of queens, then if I set about generating all the possible arrangements for the first queen, by definition the subsequent queens would have to come _after_ each queen's position.

Before writing out the code for this small improvement, I'll share what happened when I tested my conjecture.

### disaster!

First, I had neglected to insert code to halt the program when it found a solution. Perhaps I wanted to print all of the solutions. Second, I tried to optimize my test subroutine at the same time, and inserted a bug. Or perhaps, the bug was already there, but it didn't manifest itself until the program was deeper into its search, and my "optimization" took it to the failure case more quickly.

In any event, I left the updated program running overnight, and once again returned before breakfast to see if it had found any solutions. When I entered the room, there was a horrible smell and a deafening clacking sound. The test function had failed at some point, and it was passing thousands of positions in rapid order.

The paper roll had jammed at some point in the night and was no longer advancing, but the teletype had hammered through the paper and was hammering on the roller behind. Rolls of paper had emerged from the machine and lay in a heap around it. I consider it a very lucky escape that a spark hadn't ignited the paper or its dust that hung in the air.

I shut everything down, cleaned up as best I could, and then set about finding the bug.
