title: Type-Fu Fighting

```
Everybody was type-fu fighting
Compiling fast as lightning
In fact it was a little bit frightening
But their code had early binding

They were funky ML men from funky CAML town
They were chopping classes up and they were chopping classes down
It's the ancient Curry's art, in Haskell but not Dart
It's a reconstructed Lisp, without the unsafe bits

Everybody was type-fu fighting
Compiling fast as lightning
In fact it was a little bit frightening
But their code had early binding

There was funky R. Hindley and little R. Milner
He said "Here comes the big boss, Simon Peyton-Jones"
Signatures we used to write by hand, have vanished from our land
Type inference made me skip, a parametric polymorphic trip

Everybody was type-fu fighting
Compiling fast as lightning
In fact it was a little bit frightening
But their code had early binding

(repeat)..make sure you have early binding
Type-fu fighting, compiling fast as lightning
```
