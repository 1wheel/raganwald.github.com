### combinators

The word "combinator" has a precise technical meaning in mathematics:

> "A combinator is a higher-order function that uses only function application and earlier defined combinators to define a result from its arguments."--[Wikipedia][combinators]

[combinators]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combinatory_logic "Combinatory Logic"

In this essay, we will be using a much looser definition of "combinator:" Pure functions that act on other functions to produce functions. If Objects are nouns and Methods are verbs, **Combinators are the adverbs of programming**.

If we were learning Combinatorial Logic, we'd start with the most basic combinators like `S`, `K`, and `I`, and work up from there to practical combinators. We'd learn that the fundamental combinators are named after birds following the example of Raymond Smullyan's famous book [To Mock a Mockingbird][mock]. Needless to say, the title of the book and its central character is the inspiration for this essay!

There are an infinite number of combinators, but in this article we will focus on the *mockingbird*, also called the `M` combinator, or sometimes the Ï‰ or "little omega."[^little-omega]

## Notes

[^little-omega]: The "little omega" notation comes from David C Keenan's delightful [To Dissect a Mockingbird](http://dkeenan.com/Lambda/) web page.
