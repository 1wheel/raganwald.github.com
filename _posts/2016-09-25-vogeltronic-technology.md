### a true story

Once upon a time, I went for a round of job interviews with an interesting company.[^interview] Things went well in the behavioural and technical segments, then I sat down with the President, who introduced themselves as being an industry veteran who provided the "adult supervision" for the company.

[^interview]: Yes, I have been to a lot of job interviews. That happens when you spend three decades working in a high-turnover, volatile industry. It happens even more to some people in this industry than others. As Mark Cuban boasts, "I have been fired more times than most people have had jobs." Mind you, he's a billionaire, and I often find myself gathering up all the change in my house to buy lunch.

"I see you worked at LeMond?"[^pseudonyms] Of course I had, my referral to these interviews was from a colleague there.

[^pseudonyms]: All names are pseudonyms, of course, and some other details have been fictionalized.

"Do you know a programmer named Leo Vogel?" Everyone at LeMond knew Leo. Yes I did.

"Then tell me: What do you think about Leo? Be as specific as possible." I felt a yawning chasm open up under my feet, and my sixth, seventh, and eighth senses were all screaming that this question was a trap.

I took a long sip from my water to buy myself time, composed my emotions, and decided, as usual, to be truthful.

### lemond

LeMond was an interesting company. It made software tools for businesses and other organizations, and it had survived, even thrived, as several waves of technology had washed over the business computing industry.

LeMond had been formed by two college roommates. They had been taught that businesses used IBM and DEC hardware, but in the university everyone used Unix, and programmers seemed to vastly prefer working in "The Unix Style."

Unix was clearly inferior for business processing purposes, but LeMond's founders mixed a little idealism, with a dash of "If programmers are more productive, businesses will buy it," topped with "We want to play with this stuff, so let's try it and see if we can make a go of a company."

As things worked out, minicomputers running Unix were becoming a thing, and LeMond did well making software for business processing, called "Business Components." Programmers writing software for minicomputers would integrate LeMond's "business components" into their code and save themselves some time and trouble.

Leo was one of LeMond's first hires, and he quickly earned a reputation for turning assignments around very, very quickly.

Then the IBM PC arrived, and LeMond had its first real test of maturity as a company. Their existing customers were all very happy with their Unix systems, and most of the software they were running would not run on a PC: It was either too big and sophisticated, or was multi-user.

Serious businesses considered the PC a toy, even if it was backed by IBM. Oh sure, businesses bought a few PCs, and paid analysts for case studies and white papers, and somebody would be assigned to write up a report about the opportunities and costs of adopting PC technology. But absolutely none of LeMond's customers were asking LeMond to write PC software.

So they didn't. They carried on working on a long list of features and enhancements dictated by perfectly rational win/loss marketing analysis, feedback from customers, and the dictates of industry analysts.

### leo

But a funny thing happened. Leo bought themselves a PC. I don't know the story behind it, they might have wanted to play with its "Flight Simulator," or maybe they thought they could run Unix on the Desktop. But however it came to be, Leo had a PC and actually set it up in the office.

It wasn't long before Leo was fooling around with writing software for the PC. Coffee break conversations began to include monologues from Leo about somebody called Philippe Kahn, and debates about the benefits of coding in C and assembler versus the UCSD p-system.

One day, the company founders decided that Leo simply had to get back to work, and they called them onto the carpet. They were nice people, so instead of chewing Leo out about their PC obsession, the founders decided to begin diplomatically by asking what the PC was doing to make LeMond money.

"Ah!" Leo beamed, finally someone was listening. "I'll be right back!"

Leo left the conference room and returned with the PC. Leo needed a few more trips, but after some fiddling the PC was set up in the conference room and everyone was clustered around the 12-inch colour display.

Leo booted everything up and then typed the magic incantation: `LeMond.exe`.

With much squeaking and grinding, the PC laboriously booted... A programming editor!

The founders were silent. At long last, one spoke: "What is this good for?"

### lemond.exe

Leo was enthusiastic. "Well, I wanted to see if we could get our suite of Business Components running on a PC. But frankly, the tooling is TERRIBLE, just awful. Nobody can work like this. So before I could write a business component, I had to write a programming editor."

The founders were, well, dumbfounded. There were so many reasons why this was a terrible waste of time that they crowded the mind like a traffic jam, shutting down the ability to pick one and speak. Leo, oblivious to their body language, continued.

"I mean, the PC is such a terrible platform, there is no way anybody is going to do any serious programming on it without a programming editor. And without serious programmers, there is won't be anybody to buy our Business Components. So I wrote one."

Finally, one of the founders managed to speak. "This is all very nice, but what made you think it would sell?"

Leo beamed. "Oh, that's no problem. I mentioned it on a BBS, and I have ten preorders already. Well, not invoices or anything, but they say they'll buy it, and even if only half of them want it, that's five sales."

The other founder, who hadn't spoken yet, wanted to ask what a "BBS" was, but decided that things were surreal enough, and there was a definite risk that the conversation would veer even further off base.

Now it would be nice if the founders in this story clapped Leo on the back, broke open a bottle of champagne, and then devoted 40% of their marketing budged to `lemond.exe`, but that's not what really happened. There was much back-and-forth, much hand-wringing, and yes, five sales, but `lemond.exe` became a product, and it had modest sales.

And no, Business Components did not become a big thing on the PC, a funny thing called VisiCalc did, and then another funny thing called Excel, but `lemond.exe` spawned a few other programming tools for PC programmers, and LeMond was happy, and Leo went back to working on things that everybody agreed were priorities.

And then Windows happened.
