In "[Making sense of MVP (Minimum Viable Product)—and why I prefer Earliest Testable/Usable/Lovable][mvp]," [Henrik Kniberg] explains the salient distinction between fake-agile and real-agile development by contrasting two ways of developing a product, "Not like this…" and "Like this."

### not like this…

The "Not like this…" way to develop software is to work in increments, each of which represents a portion of what we plan to build. In this way, nothing is expected to be "wasted," since everything we build is a necessary part of the finished work.

However, at each step along the way, we have *potential* value, but not realized value: Until the very end, the unfinished work does not actually represent value to the customer. It is not potentially shippable, potentially loveable, or even criticizable.

Whereas, the "Like this" way to develop software consists of building an approximation of what we plan to build, then successively refining and adding value to it with each iteration. Much is intentionally "disposable" along the way.

Unlike the "Not like this…" way, at each step the "Like this" way delivers *realized* value. Each "iteration" is potentially shippable, potentially loveable, and can be usefully critiqued.

### engineering like this

All "engineers" building products should appreciate the "Like this" way from a product perspective, because everyone who builds a product is in the product management business, not just those with the words "product" or "manager" on their business card.
