Many people get an "aha!" moment when they look at that illustration by [Henrik Kniberg].

### not like this…

The "Not like this…" way to develop software is to work in increments, each of which represents a portion of what we plan to build. In this way, nothing is expected to be "wasted," since everything we build is a necessary part of the finished work.

However, at each step along the way, we have *potential* value, but not realized value: Until the very end, the unfinished work does not actually represent value to the customer. It is not potentially shippable, potentially loveable, or even criticizable.

Whereas, the "Like this" way to develop software consists of building an approximation of what we plan to build, then successively refining and adding value to it with each iteration. Much is intentionally "disposable" along the way.

Unlike the "Not like this…" way, at each step the "Like this" way delivers *realized* value. Each "iteration" is potentially shippable, potentially loveable, and can be usefully critiqued.

This model has been discussed many times form the perspective of product management. Henrik explains it particularly well in [Making sense of MVP (Minimum Viable Product) – and why I prefer Earliest Testable/Usable/Lovable][mvp]. All "engineers" building products should appreciate it from a product perspective, because everyone who builds a product is in the product management business, not just those with the words "product" or "manager" on their business card.
