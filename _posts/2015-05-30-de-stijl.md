*Disclaimer: JavaScript the language has some complicated edge cases, and as such, the following essay has some hand-wavey bits and some bits that are usually correct but wrong for certain edge cases. If it helps any, pretend that nearly every statement has a footnote reading, "for most cases in practice, however \_\_\_\_\_\_."*

ECMASCript-2015 gives us three different variable declaration statements: `var`, `let`, and `const`. Language features are interesting, but they aren't free: Every feature we use in a program increases its surface area, and the additional complexity of the tool should be justified by the simplification it brings to the program.

We already had `var`. What value do `let` and `const` confer? And is that value enough to justify their use?

One way to answer that question is to performa  thought experiment: Take a function using one of these features, and convert it to an equivalent function that doesn't use the feature. We can look and see exactly how much code and accidental complexity we lose when we remove the feature.

### is var necessary?

To get a feel for this, we can start with `var`. Is `var` really necessary in function scope? Can we write JavaScript without it? And let's make it interesting: Can we get rid of `var` without using `let`?

Variables declared with `var` have exactly the same scope as function arguments. So, one strategy for removing `var` from functions is to replace declared variables with function arguments.

So:

{% highlight javascript %}
function callFirst (fn, larg) {
  return function () {
    var args = Array.prototype.slice.call(arguments, 0);
    
    return fn.apply(this, [larg].concat(args))
  }
}
{% endhighlight %}

Would become:

{% highlight javascript %}
function callFirstWithoutVar (fn, larg) {
  return function (args) {
    args = Array.prototype.slice.call(arguments, 0);
    
    return fn.apply(this, [larg].concat(args))
  }
}
{% endhighlight %}

We can manually hoist any `var` that doesn't appear at the top of the function, so:

{% highlight javascript %}
function repeat (num, fn) {
  var i;
  
  for (i = 1; i <= num; ++i)
    var value = fn(i);
  
  return value;
}
{% endhighlight %}

Would become:

{% highlight javascript %}
function repeat (num, fn, i, value) {
  i = value = undefined;
  
  for (i = 1; i <= num; ++i)
    value = fn(i);
  
  return value;
}
{% endhighlight %}

There are a few flaws with this approach, most significantly that the code we write is misleading to human readers: It clutters the function's signature with its local variables.[^arity] Fortunately, there's a fix: We can wrap function bodies in IIFEs[^iife] and give the IIFEs the extra parameters. Like this:

[^arity]: It also changes the arity of our functions. That can matter for certain meta-programming implementations. 

{% highlight javascript %}
function repeat (num, fn) {
  return ((i, value) => {
    for (i = 1; i <= num; ++i)
      value = fn(i);
  
    return value;
  })();
}
{% endhighlight %}

Now our function has its original signature, and we have the expected behaviour. The flaw with this approach, of course, is that our function is more complicated both in code *and* behaviour: There's this confusing `return ((i, value) => {` and `})();` stuff going on, and even though we all love the techniques espoused in [JavaScript AllongÃ©][ja6], this appears a bit gratuitous.

And at runtime, we are creating an extra closure with every invocation. This has performance implications, memory implications, and it certainly isn't doing our stack traces any favours.

But we get the general idea: If we were willing to live with this code, we could get rid of a lot or even all uses of `var` from our programs. Now, what about `let`?

### is let necessary?

What if we wanted to remove `let` and just program with `var`? Or perhaps remove `let` altogether? Can it be done?

`let` has a more complicated behaviour, but if we are careful, we can translate `let` declarations into IIFEs that use `var`. And of course, if we want to remove `let` altoogether, if we can translate `let` into `var`, and we can remove `var` altogether,w e can remove `let` altogether as well.

The simplest case is when a `let` is at the top-level of a function. In that case, we can replace it with a `var`.[^except] And from there, if we are removing both `let` and `var`, we can excise it completely.

[^except]: There are some edge cases with respect to the behaviour of `let` and variables used before they are declared, but the basic principle here is straightforward.

So:

{% highlight javascript %}
function arraySum (array) {
  let done,
      sum = 0,
      i = 0;
  
  while ((done = i == array.length, !done)) {
    sum += array[i++];
  }
  return sum
}
{% endhighlight %}

Would become:

{% highlight javascript %}
function arraySum (array) {
  var done,
      sum = 0,
      i = 0;
  
  while ((done = i == array.length, !done)) {
    sum += array[i++];
  }
  return sum
}
{% endhighlight %}

And then:

{% highlight javascript %}
function arraySum (array) {
  return ((done, sum, i) => {
    sum = i = 0;
    
    while ((done = i == array.length, !done)) {
      sum += array[i++];
    }
    return sum
  })();
}
{% endhighlight %}

That works.[^enuf]

[^enuf]: From now on, we'll just translate `let` into `var` and leave removing `let` altogether as an exercise for the reader.

Now what about `let` inside a block? This is, after all, it's claim to fame. The least complicated case is when the body of the block does not contain a `return`. In that case, we use the same IIFE technique, but don't return anything. So this variation:

{% highlight javascript %}
function arraySum (array) {
  let done,
      sum = 0,
      i = 0;
  
  while ((done = i == array.length, !done)) {
    let value = array[i++]
    sum += value;
  }
  return sum
}
{% endhighlight %}

Would become:

{% highlight javascript %}
function arraySum (array) {
  var done,
      sum = 0,
      i = 0;
    
  while ((done = i == array.length, !done)) {
    (() => {
      var value = array[i++];
      sum += value;
    })();
  }
  return sum
}
{% endhighlight %}

By the way, the performance is worse than rubbish, because we're creating and discarding our IIFE on every trip through the roof. In cases, like this, we can avoid a lot of that by cleverly  "hoisting" the IIFE out of the loop:

{% highlight javascript %}
function arraySum (array) {
  var done,
      sum = 0,
      i = 0,
      __closure = () => {
        var value = array[i++];
        sum += value;
      };
    
  while ((done = i == array.length, !done)) __closure();
  return sum
}
{% endhighlight %}

### loops and blocks

`let` has special rules for loops. So if we simplify our `arraySum` with a `for...in` loop, we'll need an IIFE around the `for` loop to prevent any `let` within the loop from leaking into the surrounding scope, and one inside the `for` loop to preserve its value within the block. Let's write a completely contrived function:

{% highlight javascript %}
function sumFrom (original, i) {
  let sum = 0,
      array = original.slice(i);
  
  for (let i in array) {
    sum += array[i];
  }
  return `The sum of the numbers ${original.join(', ')} from ${i} is ${sum}`
}
{% endhighlight %}

This can be rewritten as:

{% highlight javascript %}
function sumFrom (original, i) {
  var sum = 0,
      array = original.slice(i),
      __closure = (i) => sum += array[i];;
  (() => {
    var i;
    
    for (i in array) __closure(i);
  })();

  return `The sum of the numbers ${original.join(', ')} from ${i} is ${sum}`
}
{% endhighlight %}

Some blocks contain a `return`, and that returns from the nearest enclosing function. But if we replace the block with an IIFE, the `return` will return to the IIFE. When the IIFE surrounds the entire body of the function, we can just return whatever the IIFE returns, as we do above. But when the IIFE represents a block within the body of the function, we can only return the value of the block if it returns something.

So something like this:

{% highlight javascript %}
function maybe (fn) {
  return function (...args) {
    for (let arg of args) {
      if (arg == null) return null;
    }
    return fn.apply(this, args)
  }
}
{% endhighlight %}

Becomes this:

{% highlight javascript %}
function maybe (fn) {
  return function (...args) {
    var __iife_returns,
        __closure = (arg) => {
      if (arg == null) return null;
    };
    
    __iife_returns = (() => {
      var arg, __closure_returns;
      
      for (arg of args) {
        __closure_returns = __closure(arg);
        
        if (__closure_returns !== undefined) return __closure_returns;
      }
    })();
    if (__iife_returns !== undefined) return __iife_returns;
    
    return fn.apply(this, args)
  }
}
{% endhighlight %}

We'll leave it as "an exercise for the reader" to sort out how to handle a `return` that doesn't return anything:

{% highlight javascript %}
function maybe (fn) {
  return function (...args) {
    for (let arg of args) {
      if (arg == null) return;
    }
    return fn.apply(this, args)
  }
}
{% endhighlight %}

Or a return when we don't know what we are returning:

{% highlight javascript %}
function maybe (fn) {
  return function (...args) {
    for (let arg of args) {
      if (arg == null) return arg;
    }
    return fn.apply(this, args)
  }
}
{% endhighlight %}

### what have we learnt from removing var and let?

The first thing we've learnt is that for most purposes, `var` and `let` aren't *strictly* necessary in JavaScript. Roughly speaking, scoping constructs with lexical scope can be mechanically transformed into  functional arguments.

This is not news, it's how `let` was originally written in the Scheme flavour of Lisp, and it's how `do` works in CoffeeScript to provide let-like behaviour.

So one argument is, we could strip these out of the language to provide a more minimal set of features. Or we could just use `var`, and translate all `let`s to `var`.

However, looking at the code we would have to write if we didn't have `var`, or if we had to write `let` without `var`, it's clear that while a language without `let` would be smaller, the programs we write in it would be larger. 

This is a case where taking something away does not create elegance. If we take `let` away and only use `var`, we have to add IIFEs to get block scope. If we take `var` away too, we get even more IIFEs. Removing `let` makes our programs less elegant.

### wait, what about const?

As you know, `const` behaves exactly like `let`, however when a program is first parsed, it is analyzed, and if there are any lines of code that attempt to assign to a `const` variable, an error is generated. This happens *before* the program is executed, it's a syntax error, not a runtime error.

Presuming that it compiles correctly and you haven't attempted to rebind a `const` name, `const` is exactly the same as `let` at runtime. Therefore, removing `const` from a working program is as simple as replacing it with `let`. So the following:

{% highlight javascript %}
function sumFrom (original, i) {
  let sum = 0;
  const array = original.slice(i);
  
  for (let i in array) {
    sum += array[i];
  }
  return `The sum of the numbers ${original.join(', ')} from ${i} is ${sum}`
}
{% endhighlight %}

Can be translated to:

{% highlight javascript %}
function sumFrom (original, i) {
  let sum = 0,
      array = original.slice(i);
  
  for (let i in array) {
    sum += array[i];
  }
  return `The sum of the numbers ${original.join(', ')} from ${i} is ${sum}`
}
{% endhighlight %}

### one of these things is not like the others

As we can see, `const` is not like `var` or `let`. Removing `var` by changing it into parameters involves the creation of additional IIFEs, cluttering the code and changing the runtime behaviour. Removing `let` adds much more complexity again. But removing `const` by changing it into `let` is benign. It doesn't add any complexity to the code or the runtime behaviour.

This is not surprising: `const` isn't a scoping construct, it's a *typing* construct. It exists to make assertions about the form of the program, not about its runtime behaviour. That's why languages like C++ implement `const` as an annotation on top of an existing declaration. If JavaScript followed the same philosophy, `const` would be an annotation on top of an existing declaration:

It might look something like this:

{% highlight javascript %}
@const function sumFrom (original, i) {
  let sum = 0;
  let @const array = original.slice(i);
  
  for (let i in array) {
    sum += array[i];
  }
  return `The sum of the numbers ${original.join(', ')} from ${i} is ${sum}`
}
{% endhighlight %}

`const` is not like `var` or `let`. The secret to understanding `const` is to understand that it's a shorthand for `let` with an annotation, as hypothetically shown above. But it's really just a `let`, as you can see by transforming `const` to `let`.

### what is the value proposition of const?

The value proposition of const is that we have an annotation that is enforced by static analysis. It's like a comment that can never mislead the reader, because the compiler forces you to either not rebind a `const` or to switch from `const` to `let`.

How valuable is this comment to the reader of the code?

There's some argument that restricting variables to being constant makes a function easier to reason about. Of course that's true. But note well that if you don't rebind references, a function is just as easy to reason about if you use `const` as if you use `let`. It's just that with `let`, you have to read the whole function to see which variables are rebound and which aren't.

The value of `const` is that you don't have to examine everywhere the variable is used to know that the variable is not rebound. This point cannot be repeated enough, but I'll settle for repeating it just once: **The value of `const` is that you don't have to examine everywhere the variable is used to know that the variable is not rebound.**

### const vs. immutability

To see why this is the essence of the matter, consider a related, but mostly orthogonal idea, *immutability of data*. With immutable data, you have a data structure, like an array, and you never change it. Nothing is added or removed. No elements are changed.

Guaranteeing that an array is immutable means examining everywhere the array is accessed and verifying that none of those accesses mutate the array, much as guaranteeing that a variable is `const` means examining everywhere the variable is used and verifying that none of those uses change its binding.

These two things sound the same, but they are not. Variables are very narrowly scoped: In JavaScript, you can see every single access of a variable within the lexical scope of the function. There are no other ways to rebind it. JavaScript does not have indirect variable access like SNOBOL. It does not have pointers to variables like C. It does not have call-by-reference like C++. It does not treat the environment as a mutable dictionary.[^eval]

So with a variable, we always know exactly what we have to review. Reasoning about variables is easy.

[^eval]: Then again, there's always `eval`.

Data, on the other hand, is not narrowly scoped. Objects are passed by reference to functions. Objects are returned by reference from functions. Object properties can be dynamically accessed with `[]`. To truly understand whether an object is mutated, you need to examine the whole programâincluding libraries and standard classesâand even then there are lots of common cases for which you can make no guarantee.

So with data, we do not always know what we have to review. Reasoning about data is hard.

And that's exactly why having guarantees about immutability are so valuable in the languages that provide them. But reasoning about variable rebinding is quite a bit easier. And thus, providing a guarantee is considerably less valuable.

### soâ¦ should we use var, let, and const?

One can see immediately that `var` and `let` may be theoretically unnecessary, but in practice make the functions we write simpler, and therefore easier to read and write. `const` does not make functions simpler than `let`, but does provide a kind of annotation. It is not nearly as useful as immutable data, because the problem it solves is easy, not hard.
