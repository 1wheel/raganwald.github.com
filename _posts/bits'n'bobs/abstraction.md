### abstraction, encapsulation and information hiding

> [Abstraction] in its main sense is a conceptual process where general rules and concepts are derived from the usage and classification of specific examples, literal ("real" or "concrete") signifiers, first principles, or other methods.
>
> "An abstraction" is the outcome of this process—a concept that acts as a super-categorical noun for all subordinate concepts, and connects any related concepts as a group, field, or category.—[Wikipedia][Abstraction]

[Abstraction]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstraction

There are two definitions of [encapsulation]. The first is, "A language mechanism for restricting direct access to some of the object's components." The point of encapsulation is to hide things.

[encapsulation]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encapsulation_(computer_programming)

The second definition of encapsulation is, "A language construct that facilitates the bundling of data with the methods (or other functions) operating on that data." This definition speaks of bundling related things together, but not of enforcing restricted access to an object's "internals."

Those who prefer the second definition use a different phrase to speak fo restricting access, [information hiding]:

> In computer science, [information hiding] is the principle of segregation of the design decisions in a computer program that are most likely to change, thus protecting other parts of the program from extensive modification if the design decision is changed. The protection involves providing a stable interface which protects the remainder of the program from the implementation (the details that are most likely to change).
