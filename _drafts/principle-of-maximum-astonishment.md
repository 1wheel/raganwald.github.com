> The **principle of least astonishment** (POLA/PLA) applies to user interface design, software design, and ergonomics. It is alternatively referred to as the **rule or law of least astonishment**, or the **rule or principle of least surprise** (POLS).

> A textbook formulation is "People are part of the system. The design should match the user's experience, expectations, and mental models..."  The principle aims to exploit users' pre-existing knowledge as a way to minimize the learning curve for instance by designing interfaces *borrowing heavily from "functionally similar or analogous programs with which your users are likely to be familiar."*

This sounds nice in principle, but I'm fascinated by *maximizing* astonishment.
