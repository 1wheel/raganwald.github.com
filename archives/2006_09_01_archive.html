					<div style="clear:both;"></div>There is only one problem with development methodologies. Just one. It affects <span style="font-style: italic;">all</span> methodologies, agile and otherwise: No methodology can 'fix' projects that are staffed with underperforming people. People are more important than process, period.<br /><br />This is the underlying issue with the language 'wars' as well. No magical combination of JSON, static typing, design patterns, IDE whizzies, and frameworks will somehow help a million monkeys produce any of Shakespeare's works.<br /><br /><span class="body"><blockquote>If you want to build a ship, don't drum up people to collect wood and don't assign them tasks and work, but rather teach them to long for the endless immensity of the sea.</blockquote></span><div style="text-align: right;"><a href="http://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/authors/a/antoine_de_saintexupery.html">Antoine de Saint-Exupery</a><br /></div><br />Steve Yegge has <a href="http://steve-yegge.blogspot.com/2006/09/good-agile-bad-agile_27.html">suggested</a> that if 90% of the projects adopting a methodology fail, you have to stop blaming the people. You have to stop saying "you're not doing it right." You have to say <span style="font-style: italic;">there's something wrong with the methodology itself if 90% of the projects fail to use it properly</span>.<br /><span style="font-style: italic;"><br /></span>Sounds reasonable. But why would this be true for methodologies but not true for programming languages?<br /><br />99.999% of the software written in almost any language (including Lisp, Python, and Ruby) is buggy. Yet we readily say that the problem is the programmer. We think that some languages are better than others, that some languages help eliminate certain classes of bugs, but we take as a given that good tools are not sufficient unto themselvesfor good results. We know that the quality of the result is almost entirely driven by the quality of the programmer.<br /><br /><blockquote>I have the uncomfortable feeling that others are making a religion out of it, as if the conceptual problems of programming could be solved by a single trick, by a simple form of coding discipline!</blockquote><div style="text-align: right;">Edsger Dijkstra<br /></div><br />Home Depot might suggest that buying a new table saw will cause beautiful woodwork to appear in your home. Yet just because a duffer with a table saw cannot make built-in closets all by himself, we don't abandon table saws outright. We assume that good woodworking is <span style="font-style: italic;">better</span> with good tools. And if we are blessed with the skill to make a built-in closet with a hand saw, we know that we can also make the closet with a table saw, and <span style="font-style: italic;">we judge the table saw on whether and how it can improve the results we could have obtained with another tool</span>.<br /><br />This is my criteria for judging a methodology. Can it improve a team that is already fundamentally qualified to write software?<br /><br />If you want to stop reading here, my statement is that you can only judge a methodology on the basis of the results it delivers for a team that has already proven it can ship software. You judge it on the basis of <span style="font-style: italic;">incremental value</span>. You don't compare its results to the results some other team gets, or to your fantasy of what results the team 'ought' to get.<br /><span style="font-style: italic;"><br /></span><span style="font-weight: bold;">The mythical marginal</span><span style="font-style: italic;"><br /></span><br />What I've written seems obvious. Yet, billions of dollars are paid every year to people who are selling a different perspective. What is it that causes companies to buy silver bullet after silver bullet? Why do companies lurch from consultant to methodology to programming language like infomercial junkies looking for something that will flatten their tummies without sweaty exercise or unpleasant diets?<br /><br />I bifurcate teams into those that are fundamentally qualified and those that aren't. And I believe that to fix an unqualified team, you start with the people, not the process or the tools. So what could the rest of the IT industry possibly believe?<br /><br />I have observed a belief in a marginal team. A team that is somehow straddling the fence between incompetence and competence. They can ship software, but only with help from their process and tools. If 'marginal' is too perjorative a term, you could think of them as having <span style="font-style: italic;">unactualized potential</span>.<br /><br />In truth, I have worked with several such teams, so I believe they exist. However, I believe that such teams are quite rare, while proponents of silver bullets make a living convincing customers that marginal teams are commonplace.<br /><br />The primary example I have observed of a marginal team is a team composed of individuals who are not working together well, yet they have achieved success on other teams in prior roles. Something like the Los Angeles Lakers before Phil Jackson arrived. There is a lot of latent championship potential in the individuals, but the team isn't performing.<br /><blockquote>Shipping software is not an emergant property of competent programming, nor is it a consequence of management technique.</blockquote>Why does the IT industry believe that perhaps most teams that fail are marginal teams? They have to believe this, otherwise they wouldn't waste time and money trying new silver bullets ("everything should be a stored procedure," "tests are the only documentation that matter").<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">It always comes back to hiring</span><br /><br />My broken-record assertion is that the industry as a whole embraces the above model of a marginal team: latent potential in the individuals. The difference between the industry and I is that I have an objective measure of latent potential: <span style="font-style: italic;">has the individual demonstrated success shipping software in the past</span>.<br /><span class="body"></span><blockquote><span class="body">True happiness comes from the joy of deeds well done, the zest of creating things new.</span> </blockquote><div style="text-align: right;"><a href="http://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/authors/a/antoine_de_saintexupery.html">Antoine de Saint-Exupery</a><br /></div><br />The industry doesn't apply this test rigorously, if at all. A typical interview with a developer focuses on patterns and archiecture, on talking about past achievements. Developer's don't <a href="http://raganwald.github.com/2006/07/hiring-juggler_02.html">juggle</a>. Developer's don't <a href="http://raganwald.github.com/2006/06/my-favourite-interview-question.html">design software</a>. And especially, managers don't hire developers with super-strong references from strong employees that have worked with the candidate in the past.<br /><br />Basically, managers ask developers if they can ship software and then take the candidate's word for it. If you take only one thing from this blog post, take this: <span style="font-style: italic;">shipping software is not an emergant property of competent programming, nor is it a consequence of management technique</span>. Someone can demonstrate the ability to write software but lack the ability to actually ship software.<br /><br /><span style="font-style: italic;">(Update</span>: nothing in this post should be construed to suggest that people cannot become better developers through study, mentorships, or training. However, training is to hiring as tools are to skill. And they are not mutually exclusive, any more than good programmers and good tools are mutually exclusive.)<br /><br />I believe that the reason why the IT industry believes that most failing teams are marginal rather than outright incompetent is that they believe that these teams are composed of individuals who can write software and managers who can direct work. All they need are the right tools to write software "better" and better software will emerge. All they need is a methodology to manage software development better and software will ship.<br /><br />If you have a marginal team, a team composed of individuals with proven ability to ship working software, you might have something there. But if a team isn't even marginal, no methodology will help. And that's why a useful methodology can still fail to help 90% of the teams that try it.<br /><br />For the same reason that Wasabi makes Sushi divine.<br /><br /><span style="font-size:85%;">Follow-up: <a style="font-style: italic;" href="http://raganwald.github.com/2006/10/three-questions-and-three-answers.html">Three questions and three answers about Wasabi and Rotten Fish</a></span><br /><br /><span style="font-size:85%;">Postscript: <span style="font-style: italic;">The difference between Sashimi and Nigiri</span></span><br /><br /><span style="font-size:85%;">If we're judging success or failure of a development methodology, we have to judge the results on whether the development itself was successful. We can't judge whether the software made money, or whether the company's stock soared. Such things can be studied, however those are <span style="font-style: italic;">product management<span style="font-style: italic;"> </span></span>problems, not <span style="font-style: italic;">software development problems.<br /><br /></span>People have criticised Google, saying that althought it has a track record for shipping products, only one, AdWords, is financially successful. If you want to compare product management methodologies, that's fine, but you aren't talking about software development. You have to compare similar kinds of projects, for example you can't compare an in-house IT project with a known ROI (reduce the time spent entering a new Blort Ticket by 50%, saving $47.32 per week per Fizbang team member) to speculative product development like a new Web 2.0 calendar.<br /><br />Who else is trying to create new products? Apple? Microsoft? Dan Bricklin? Compare <span style="font-style: italic;">them</span> to Google, and if they are doing a better job of making money with their projects, post a critique of Google's product management on your blog.<br /><br />-r.b.<br /></span><div style="clear:both; padding-bottom:0.25em"></div><p class="blogger-labels">Labels: <a rel='tag' href="http://raganwald.github.com/labels/agile.html">agile</a>, <a rel='tag' href="http://raganwald.github.com/labels/popular.html">popular</a></p>&nbsp;

					<div style="clear:both;"></div><blockquote>DSLs are a hard way to sell your language. They haven't worked for Lisp yet. Before you can sell Ruby based on DSLs, you need to tell people why they need DSLs.</blockquote><div style="text-align: right;"><span class="post-author">Cynos, <a href="http://kunosure.blogspot.com/2006/09/ruby-and-python-theres-no-fight.html">Ruby and Python - there's no fight</a></span><br /></div><br />My sales background tells me that people want holes, not <a href="http://www.team.net/mjb/hawg.html">drills</a>, and especially not drill bits. For that reason, you have to sell the holes themselves, not the technology for making them.<br /><br />It's a mistake to 'sell' DSLs, just as it's a mistake to sell metaprogramming. Wherever programmers <a href="http://programming.reddit.com">hang out</a>, you'll find people arguing the merits of high signal-to-noise techniques like DSLs. It's fun and instructive to have this debate, <span style="font-style: italic;">but it isn't selling</span>. It's coffee-shop banter about drill bits, and whether diamond tips are worth the price, and are all carpenters equal or are some better than others, and should all drills have safeties so any monkey can make holes, and can you do concurrent drilling with a drill press framework?<br /><br />Lots of people love the way Ruby on Rails makes certain things declarative and makes their code smaller than whatever else they used to use. They love the <span style="font-style: italic;">holes</span>, and that's as it should be. DSLs and metaprogramming are implementation details for framework builders, not selling features for framework <span style="font-style: italic;">users</span>.<br /><br />At least, not up front. Later, after they've gotten hooked on drilling holes, they'll be interested in drill technology. :-)<div style="clear:both; padding-bottom:0.25em"></div>&nbsp;

					<div style="clear:both;"></div><blockquote>Every decade or so we have a major revolution in the way we develop software and the environments we develop for. But, unlike the object and web revolutions, we can see the concurrency revolution coming.</blockquote><div style="text-align: right;">Herb Sutter, <a href="http://www.gotw.ca/publications/guest-ed-200609.htm">It's (Not) All Been Done</a><br /></div>Awesome.<br /><br />I've watched and participated on the periphery of several "waves" of computing progress. Yes, I wrote my very first SNOBOL programs on punch cards. Yes, I wrote a networked database application in MP/M. Yes, I wrote commercial software for Macintosh and marvelled at its Toolbox. And to learn Java, I used it to write a Scheme interpreter. (And yes, it did optimize tail calls and support continuations).<br /><br />So I've lived on and in this ocean we call the computing industry, or computer science, or programming, for a while. I've seen it <a href="http://wwwcsif.cs.ucdavis.edu/%7Ecsclub/museum/items/mits_altair_8800.html">roil</a>, I've seen it's <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AI_Winter">placid moments</a>. And I've seen its <a href="http://folklore.org/index.py">thundering, express train waves</a>.<br /><br />And I can tell you, <a href="http://gotw.ca/publications/concurrency-ddj.htm">it feels like another big wave is coming</a>. A monster wave. A wave of tow-in surfing epic proportions. It's damn exciting. It feels like if we paddle like hell and try to stand on our boards we could be sucked under and crushed.<br /><br />Or we could have the ride of our life, teeth bared in the most insanely happy grin we've ever worn.<br /><br />I know that after the wave hits the shore, it will obliterate half of the vending stalls and the beach blankets and the hordes of sun tanners. And when the water subsides the industry will rebuild the beach houses and the industry will reopen the vending stalls, and the people who are rich today will probably still be rich then.<br /><br />It's tempting to just wait, wait for the wave to hit and for the water to suck back into the ocean. Wait for others to solve the problems, to harness the energy. Wait until Microsoft and Sun and Apple and Linux and Apache and whoever else decide what we should do. Wait until they give us the frameworks, until they tell us where to swim.<br /><br />Wait until there's no risk, like many people did with the Web and with Java and with their whole lives.<br /><br />We can wait, just hunker on the shore and not take any chances out there in the water on our own.<br /><br />But where's the fun in that?<div style="clear:both; padding-bottom:0.25em"></div><p class="blogger-labels">Labels: <a rel='tag' href="http://raganwald.github.com/labels/passion.html">passion</a></p>&nbsp;

					<a href="http://raganwald.github.com/2006/09/ruby-metaprogramming-generic.html" title="permanent link">Ruby Metaprogramming: A generic controller for REST-ful services on Rails</a></span>
					<div style="clear:both;"></div><span style="font-weight: bold;">Disclaimer</span>:<br /><br />This is very raw code, and I've only been using it for a few days. It isn't in production. It hasn't been peer-reviewed. There are far fewer lines of test code than lines of functional code.<br /><br />In short, this is really a peek over my shoulder at what's running on my MacBook.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/raganwald/34964775/" title="Dale on the Approach"><img src="http://static.flickr.com/21/34964775_76025bb762.jpg" alt="Dale on the Approach" border="0" height="375" width="500" /></a><br /><br />It has shortcomings. I recently read a blog post where the author complained that many of the naked people at Burning Man weren't pleasing to his eyes. Fair enough. But... is nudism always about exhibitionism? I think in many cases, it's about being perfectly aware of one's lack of physical beauty but being comfortable enough with oneself that you don't need to hide inside your clothing.<br /><br />I am posting this code in that spirit. Warts and all, I am trying to get my head out of the "don't show it until it has been polished to perfection" mind set.<br /><br />If you don't find it attractive, I hope you at least find it interesting.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">What I needed</span>:<br /><br />I'm doing some work with bridging multiple Rails applications. In the back of my mind I thought I'd want to use ActiveWebServices in the production code, but when I got to the point of integrating my databases, I followed the principle of <a href="http://c2.com/xp/YouArentGonnaNeedIt.html">YAGNI</a> and decided I would use <a href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?DoTheSimplestThingThatCouldPossiblyWork">the simplest thing that could possibly work</a>.<br /><br />So I figured I would build one of the Rails applications around a REST-ful interface. The other applications could wrestle with REXML and Net::HTTP to talk to it. The joke on me is that this isn't the simplest thing that could possibly work. In my ignorance of all things Rails, I didn't know that I could have one Rails application use different databases for different models.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">Rails and REST</span>:<br /><br />Rails 1.1 makes REST controllers as easy as:<br /><pre><code>class WardersController &lt; ApplicationController<br /><br /> def index<br />     @warders = Warder.find :all<br />     respond_to do |wants|<br />         wants.html<br />         wants.xml   { render :xml =&gt; @warders.to_xml }<br />     end<br /> end<br /><br /> # ...<br /><br />end</code></pre>I also needed to implement the <code>show</code> action. Once again, it’s fairly easy to handle the default case:<br /><pre><code>def show<br /> begin<br />   @warder = Warder.find params[:id]<br />   respond_to do |wants|<br />     wants.html<br />     wants.xml { render :xml =&gt; @warder.to_xml }<br />   end<br /> rescue ActiveRecord::RecordNotFound<br />   render :nothing =&gt; true, :status =&gt; 404<br /> end<br />end<br /></code></pre>Shortly after I had this working, it was time to implement <em>filters</em>. My first need was to be able to find the first Inmate that exactly matched something other than an <code>id</code>. I believe that it is far better to extract infrastructure through refactoring common code than to over-engineer up front. But it seemed obvious that I needed a generic “find on any column” feature.<br /><br />I did cobble something together, and it worked: you could search for an inmate using a <code>GET</code> such as <code>http://thevillage.org/inmates/show?number=6</code>. Shortly after I had it working for the <code>show</code> action I discovered that I needed the exact same functionality for the <code>index</code> action as well. And it was obvious it ought to work for any model controller without resorting to copy and paste.<br /><br /><strong>Rails Controllers and Filters</strong><br /><br />This is a common concern, and Rails provides Aspect-Oriented Programming hooks for controllers called <em>filters</em> just for this kind of purpose (they’re also handy for security). I decided to write a filter. Since I wanted to use it for all of my models, I placed the filter in <code>application.rb</code>, the common superclass of all controllers.<br /><br />Let’s start with a look at what a typical controller now looks like:<br /><br /><pre><code>class InmatesController &lt; ApplicationController<br /><br />before_filter :first_inmate, :only =&gt; [ :show, :update, :edit, :destroy ]<br />before_filter :all_inmates, :only =&gt; [ :index ]<br /><br />def index<br />  respond_to do |wants|<br />    wants.html<br />    wants.xml   { render :xml =&gt; @inmates.to_xml }<br />  end<br />end<br /><br />def show<br />  if @event.nil?<br />    render :nothing =&gt; true, :status =&gt; 404<br />  else<br />    respond_to do |wants|<br />      wants.html<br />      wants.xml { render :xml =&gt; @inmate.to_xml }<br />    end<br />  end<br />end<br /><br /># ...<br /><br />end<br /></code></pre>As you can see, I’ve added <code>before_filters</code> to our actions. These filters set the instance variables <code>@inmate</code> or <code>@inmates</code> for the action’s use. You can also see that the filter methods are customized for each model class. As you’ll see in a moment, if you add a new model class, say, <code>Rover</code>, you’ll get <code>first_rover</code> and <code>all_rovers</code> methods for free.<br /><br />Here’s the code for the methods:<br /><br /><pre><code>class ApplicationController &lt; ActionController::Base<br /><br /> class &lt;&lt; self<br />   def before_filter *args<br />     method_name = args[0].to_s<br />     if method_name =~ /^first_(.*)$/<br />       class_name = Inflector.singularize((Inflector.camelize $1))<br />       instance_name = '@' + Inflector.singularize((Inflector.underscore $1))<br />       load "#{Inflector.singularize(Inflector.underscore $1)}.rb"<br />       clazz = Kernel.const_get(class_name)<br />       define_method method_name do<br />         self.instance_variable_set instance_name, (find_filter :class =&gt; clazz, :find =&gt; :first)<br />       end<br />     elsif method_name =~ /^all_(.*)$/<br />       class_name = Inflector.singularize((Inflector.camelize $1))<br />       instance_name = '@' + Inflector.pluralize((Inflector.underscore $1))<br />       load "#{Inflector.singularize(Inflector.underscore $1)}.rb"<br />       clazz = Kernel.const_get(class_name)<br />       define_method method_name do<br />         self.instance_variable_set instance_name, (find_filter :class =&gt; clazz, :find =&gt; :all)<br />       end<br />     end<br />     super<br />   end<br /> end<br /><br />private<br /><br />def find_filter options<br />  options[:find] ||= :first<br />  if params[:id]<br />    begin<br />      (options[:find] == :first &&amp; (Event.find params[:id])) || [ (Event.find params[:id]) ]<br />    rescue ActiveRecord::RecordNotFound<br />      (options[:find] == :all &&amp; []) || nil<br />    end<br />  else<br />    column_names = options[:class].column_names<br />    clauses = (column_names.inject([]) { |cond_clauses, column_name| params[column_name] &&amp; cond_clauses &lt;&lt; "#{column_name} = ?"; cond_clauses })<br />    full_conditions = (!clauses.empty? &&amp; (column_names.collect { |column_name| params[column_name] }).compact.unshift((clauses.join ' AND '))) || nil<br />    if params[:order_by]<br />      words = params[:order_by].split<br />      order_column_name = (column_names.include? words.first) &&amp; words.first<br />      if order_column_name<br />        direction = (words.last &&amp; (words.last.upcase == 'DESC') &&amp; ' DESC') || ''<br />        (full_conditions &&amp; (options[:class].find options[:find], :conditions => full_conditions, :order => "#{order_column_name}#{direction}")) || (options[:class].find options[:find], :order => "#{order_column_name}#{direction}")<br />      elsif full_conditions<br />        options[:class].find options[:find], :conditions => full_conditions<br />      else<br />        options[:class].find options[:find]<br />      end<br />    elsif full_conditions<br />      options[:class].find options[:find], :conditions => full_conditions<br />    else<br />      options[:class].find options[:find]<br />    end<br />  end<br />end<br />end<br /></code></pre>As you can see, I intercept calls to <code>before_filter</code> and define a small wrapper method around <code>find_filter</code>. I was going to introspect on the controller name to get the class, however I wanted to allow the posibility that I would create controllers with arbitrary names. And after looking at the way the filters look, the method names seem to have documentation value.<br /><br />It also seemed possible to eliminate the filter calls in the controller, but they are so short that it didn't seem like a big code win to abstract those up into <code>ApplicationController</code>.<br /><br />So... there you have it. In summary, <strong>all</strong> of the controllers in this rails application now support simple filtering on column names like <code>http://thevillage.org/escapes/outcome=failure</code> or <code>http://thevillage.org/butlers/stature=short&umbrella=yes</code>.<br /><br /><strong>My thoughts on metaprogramming</strong>:<br /><br /><blockquote>I had to stop learning Lisp. I realized that at the rate I was going I would quickly automate myself right out of a job.</blockquote><div style="text-align: right;"><a href="http://www.recursivethought.com/blog/">Senzei</a><br /></div><br />I <em>like</em> dynamic metaprogramming. Obviously. On the other hand, it’s hard to write an IDE that knows where to find the definition for <code>all_rovers</code>. I think that as Ruby matures, people will look for ways to assist tool vendors, perhaps by extending reflection.<br /><br />OO theorists sometimes complain that even this mild form of dynamic metaprogramming violates the purity of defining all of the verbs for a noun up front. At the risk of arguing with a straw man, I feel that this is well within the spirit of OOP. What we’re really saying is <em>all objects that extend <code>ApplicationController</code> have two extra methods, <code>first_something</code> and <code>all_somethings</code></em>, we just don’t know the name of <code>something</code> yet.<br /><br /><strong>Defining the methods using <code>method_missing</code></strong>:<br /><br />My first cut at the implementation used <code>method_missing</code> to handle the new methods instead of <code>define_method</code>. Stefan Tilkov's comment (below) inspired me to try defining the methods dynamically. Here's the original code:<br /><pre><code> def method_missing method<br />  method_name = method.id2name<br />  if method_name =~ /^first_(.*)$/<br />    class_name = Inflector.singularize((Inflector.camelize $1))<br />    instance_name = '@' + Inflector.singularize((Inflector.underscore $1))<br />    load "#{Inflector.singularize(Inflector.underscore $1)}.rb"<br />    clazz = Kernel.const_get(class_name)<br />    self.instance_variable_set instance_name, (find_filter :class =&gt; clazz, :find =&gt; :first)<br />  elsif method_name =~ /^all_(.*)$/<br />    class_name = Inflector.singularize((Inflector.camelize $1))<br />    instance_name = '@' + Inflector.pluralize((Inflector.underscore $1))<br />    load "#{Inflector.singularize(Inflector.underscore $1)}.rb"<br />    clazz = Kernel.const_get(class_name)<br />    self.instance_variable_set instance_name, (find_filter :class =&gt; clazz, :find =&gt; :all)<br />  else<br />    super<br />  end<br />end<br /></code></pre>While I embrace the spirit of dynamic metaprogramming, I don’t care for the aesthetics of implementing methods with <code>method_missing</code>. In my ideal world, we’d combine pattern matching with our existing syntactic forms of defining a method so that it is much more obvious that ApplicationController defines those two methods. That would be a win for programmers and for tools. And we could do that today as syntactic sugar by rewriting pattern matching definitions using <code>method_missing</code>.<div style="clear:both; padding-bottom:0.25em"></div>&nbsp;

					<div style="clear:both;"></div>It's <a href="http://raganwald.github.com/2006/07/its-friday-whos-having-fun.html">Friday</a>, so let's have some fun.<br /><br />Sinclair Schuller posted an interesting article, <em>How to Rewrite Standard Recursion through a State Stack & Iteration</em> (the original page has been removed). In his own words:<br /><blockquote>Recursion, as a construct, is quite beautiful. It offers an elegant means of achieving an algorithmic goal and is used in everything from mathematics to text processing and data structure manipulation. The problem is, using it in practice   through today's popular languages (such as my favorite, C#) can prove to be a disaster.</blockquote>The problem, quite simply, is that many <strike>flavours of <a href="http://raganwald.github.com/2006/10/are-we-blub-programmers.html">Blub</a></strike> popular languages have a limitation on how deeply you can make function calls before returning. That limit is far smaller than the limitations placed on the size of data set you can manipulate.<br /><br /><style type="text/css">.flickr-photo { border: solid 2px #000000; }.flickr-yourcomment { }.flickr-frame { text-align: left; padding: 3px; }.flickr-caption { font-size: 0.8em; margin-top: 0px; }</style><div class="flickr-frame"> <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/x180/235793166/" title="Door to Nowhere"><img src="http://static.flickr.com/80/235793166_98f61738b5.jpg" class="flickr-photo" alt="Door to Nowhere" border="0" /></a><br /><span class="flickr-caption"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/x180/235793166/">Door to Nowhere</a>, originally uploaded by <a href="http://www.flickr.com/people/x180/">x180</a>. Courtesy James Duncan Davidson</span></div><br />Recursive functions often have the property that they require storage O<span style="font-style: italic;">n</span>. Therefore, if the number of function calls you can make before returning is fixed, the size of data set you can manipulate is fixed.<br /><br />Yes, I said data set. That's very interesting, especially when you consider that Sinclair's example, the factorial function, doesn't really manipulate what most people would think of as a data set. But it really is, because if you were to think of <code>100!</code> as a macro instead of a function, you would end up with <code>1 x 2 x 3 x 4 x 5...</code> <code>x 99 x 100</code>. So there really is a set of 100 datums to manipulate.<br /><br />Now back to Sinclair's example. He shows how to emulate a programming language's call stack. This is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenspun%27s_Tenth_Rule">Greenspunning</a> at its finest:<br /><blockquote>Any sufficiently complicated C or Fortran program contains an ad hoc, informally-specified, bug-ridden, slow implementation of half of Common Lisp.</blockquote>Sinclair's transformation implements a better programming language (like Lisp) that does not have an arbitrary limit on the size of the stack it uses for function calls. This used to be a neat programming challenge. Old-timers will remember when certain languages (BASIC, FORTRAN) did not support re-entrant functions or procedures. So if you wanted to do something recursively, you had to Greenspun. (re-)Discovering this technique in order to write a "Towers of Hanoi" program was an early "Aha!" moment for me.<br /><br />I call such a transformation a pseudo-iteration. It isn't really iterative, as the presence of a stack shows. Instead, it is emulating or interpreting a recursive algorithm. Sinclair also shows how to optimize the algorithm so that it always executes in constant space (O<span style="font-style: italic;">1</span>).<br /><br />I consider this a variation on Greenspunning where instead of implementing half of Common Lisp, we implement half of <a href="http://www-swiss.ai.mit.edu/projects/scheme/">Scheme</a>. Scheme is a member of the Lisp family that can optimize tail-recursive functions. (So can most Common Lisp implementations. Maybe. As Wikipedia says: <span style="font-style: italic;">The Scheme standards documents require </span><a style="font-style: italic;" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tail_recursion" title="Tail recursion">tail-call optimization</a><span style="font-style: italic;">, which the CL standard does not. Most CL implementations do offer tail-call optimization, although often only when the programmer uses an optimization directive.</span>)<br /><br />Let's look at what's going on with some Ruby. The first thing we need is a factorial function:<br /><pre><code><span style="font-weight: bold;">def</span> factorial n # whole numbers only<br /> (([0,1].include? n) &&amp; 1) || (n * (factorial (n - 1)))<br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">end</span><br /></code></pre>(If you aren’t familiar with Ruby, what you need to know is that the <code>&&amp;</code> operator returns its last argument if all of its arguments are truthy (neither <code>nil</code> nor <code>false</code>) and the <code>||</code> operator returns its first truthy argument.)<br /><br />Okay, so the first thing we do is convert this factorial function into tail recursive form:<br /><pre><code><span style="font-weight: bold;">def</span> factorial n, acc = 1<br /> ((0 == n) &&amp; acc) || (factorial (n - 1), (n * acc))<br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">end</span><br /></code></pre>As you already know (or have learned by following the links to an explanation of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tail_recursion#Implementation_methods">tail call optimization</a>), this version of factorial has its call in <span style="font-style: italic;">tail position</span>. That means that every time it calls itself (just once), it returns the result of the call directly. The first version of the function didn't return the result directly; it called itself and then performed a multiply on the result.<br /><br />Because it does no further work with the result of the recursive call, there is <span style="font-style: italic;">no need to store the calling parameters or the result on a stack</span>. What you do is this. You set up a loop. Inside each iteration you perturb the parameters you have received. When the loop is done, you return some expression on the final set of parameters.<br /><br />As it happens, factorial is easy in this respect because the final return is simply the accumulator we had been carrying around as a parameter in the tail recursive algorithm.<br /><br />Let's perform the conversion, using this approach to omit the stack:<br /><pre><code><span style="font-weight: bold;">def</span> factorial n<br /></code><code>    acc = 1<br /></code><code>    <span style="font-weight: bold;">until</span> 0 == n<br />     acc *= n<br />     n -= 1<br /> <span style="font-weight: bold;">end</span><br /> acc<br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">end</span><br /></code></pre>We have progressed beyond half of Common Lisp into half of Scheme. Now, like a properly optimizing environment, we have greater performance and we require constant memory.<br /><br />Only we have done by hand the work that a machine (you know, a labour-saving device) could have done for us, had we used a programming language of 1970s vintage.<br /><br />How quaint.<br /><br />Update: <span style="font-style: italic;">C# and Java Leak<br /><br /></span>Why is this kind of manual transformation necessary? In the end, it is because the so-called modern programming languages are so obsessed with copying popular languages that came before them (like C and C++) that they copied the bugs as well as the features.<br /><br />The present an abstraction, function calling, but the abstraction leaks badly: you can't actually use it for non-trivial data sets. To me, this is kith and kin with the leaky abstraction known as primitive data types.<br /><blockquote>The only way to deal with the leaks competently is to learn about how the abstractions work and what they are abstracting. So the abstractions save us time working, but they don't save us time learning.<br /><br />And all this means that paradoxically, even as we have higher and higher level programming tools with better and better abstractions, becoming a proficient programmer is getting harder and harder.<br /></blockquote> <div style="text-align: right;">Joel Spolsky<br /><br /></div>I am deeply dissappointed that programmers need to do this kind of work by hand in this day and age. We have known how to release function calls from the tyranny of a fixed stack for decades. We have known how to optimize tail calls for decades.<br /><br />No matter how simple and obvious these transformations are, every time we do this by hand we are sidetracked from ading real value through innovation. Every time we do this by hand, we add some risk of defect to our software. Every time we do this by hand, we obfuscate the core expression of our intent behind the <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/LeakyAbstractions.html">leaky abstraction</a>.<div style="clear:both; padding-bottom:0.25em"></div>&nbsp;

					<div style="clear:both;"></div>Business programming simply isn't that hard, right?<br /><br />Seriously, how hard can it be to wire  a SQL database to some basic business rules ("<span style="font-style: italic;">employee HAS-A manager, employee.manager_id != employee.id</span>") and add some AJAXy goodness on top like <span style="font-style: italic;">edit_in_place</span>? Business applications are a simple pyramid with the frameworks doing the heavy lifting at the bottom and the AJAXy goodness on the top providing the sizzle that makes users say "wow." Right?<br /><br /><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/raganwald/193444521/" title="The Ultimate Pyramid"><img src="http://static.flickr.com/74/193444521_e7f11ede88_o.jpg" alt="The Ultimate Pyramid" border="0" height="545" width="487" /></a><br /><br />And needless to say, business applications are borrrring! Nothing about the programming is stimulating. It's all a question of managing requirements, priorities, and figuring out how to cram ninety hours worth of work into a seventy hour week to stave off the outsourcing.<br /><br />But... Could there be <a href="http://raganwald.github.com/2006/05/how-to-make-programming-hard-for.html">interesting problems to seek out</a> in business? Try a couple of these on for size:<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">Real time risk management</span><br /><br />You have an online banking application. Your goal is to produce a system that can alert a customer service rep when <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_fraud">suspicious activity</a> is detected so that they can telephone the customer before the customer has left the web site. How can you detect suspicious activities in real time?<br /><br />For an example of how this works, consider credit cards. I often make very large computer purchases, and they never bat an eyelash. But when I purchase <a href="http://www.tiffany.com/">jewelry</a> for my wife, I get a call. A friend swears she gets the same pattern, but they called her when she purchased an <a href="http://www.apple.com/ca/ipod/">iPod</a> because she doesn't usually purchase electronics.<br /><br />Your system will notice weird patterns, like a customer who never banks internationally suddenly trying to transfer money to Russia. But take heed: you don't want to be bothering the fur importer who regularly does business in the "Wild Wild East." You need to look for <span style="font-style: italic;">suspicious</span> patterns. And you need to explain it simply enough that a customer service rep knows how to verify the transaction with the customer.<br /><br />Did I meantion <span style="font-style: italic;">in real time</span>? Visa normally calls me within a few hours. Your goal is to make the call <span style="font-style: italic;">while the customer is still on line</span>.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">Let's get our hands dirty</span><br /><br /><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concrete">Concrete</a> is funny stuff. From the moment you start mixing it, you have a limited amount of time it can sit in the mixer truck before it has to get poured. Construction sites need so much an hour, no more and no less. A cement company can't send a customer one hundred trucks simultaneously and have them idling on site, they have to arrive just as they're needed.<br /><br />In major cities, <span style="font-style: italic;">traffic</span> is a problem. So build a system that can dispatch and direct the trucks in real time. Your input will be demand from customers plus real time traffic and road construction reports, which your system will use to update a graph representation of the road network. Naturally, it will <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shortest_path">search the network in real time for apropriate paths</a> for the trucks. They're outfitted with GPS units, so you will have real time locations for your trucks.<br /><br />Don't forget to manage the return of the empty trucks to your site. Concrete is a low margin business, so operational efficiency is a <span style="font-style: italic;">competitive advantage</span>. Do a great job, and your company could become the dominant supplier.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">update</span>:<span style="font-style: italic;"> This isn't just finding the fastest way to get trucks to their destinations. That is not a simple problem, but you must also solve the flow problem: </span><span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">when do the trucks have to leave your yard in order to arrive at each customer's site on schedule</span><span style="font-style: italic;">? If a customer is ninety minutes away and traffic is building towards ruch hour, you have to leave earlier. How much earlier? Do you send two trucks by different paths at certain times and reroute one of the trucks if the other arrives ahead of schedule? When an accident suddenly clogs the freeway, is your system able to predict how long the freeway will be closed and what the effects will be on alternate routes?<br /><br />To do this job well, you're going to have to have a really good model of traffic in the city you serve. Don't forget to build the <a href="http://bluejays.mlb.com/">baseball</a>, <a href="http://www.argonauts.on.ca/">football</a>, <a href="http://www.torontomapleleafs.com/">hockey</a>, and <a href="http://www.nba.com/raptors/">basketball</a> schedules into your system, along with big ticket concerts :-)<br /></span><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">...his lips are moving, that's how</span><br /><br />Consider any large organization that makes big-ticket sales to walk-in prospects. Let's choose car sales. Some prospects will walk in and buy right away, others will never buy. Some will buy, but only if you follow up with a call after they've been in for a test drive.<br /><br />When's the right time to call them back? If salespeople call too soon, they waste time, make the prospects feel pressured, and their quote ends up being fodder for the competition to beat and steal the business. But of they call too late, the prospect will have bought from someone else.<br /><br />Build a system that learns over time when to call each prospect. For starters, you'll have access to a survey team that will call a sample of prospects that didn't buy. They will fill out a form about the prospect (age, gender, household income, zip code, car they owned, car they bought, anything else you can gather), along with when they bought.<br /><br />This becomes your training corpus. Now build a system that the salespeople use to manage callbacks. Your system must suggest when to call the prospect in order to have the best chance of closing the deal.<br /><br />Yes, your system must be able to train itself. Yes, your system must do "meta-training": if the zip code isn't significant but the age of their existing car is significant, your system must recommend dropping the former from the survey and promoting the latter to the top of the form. And you ought to add new questions from time to time and test them for relevance.<br /><br />Oh yes, you'll have to infer distributions like the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erlang_distribution">Erlang</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution">Normal</a>, or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binomial_distribution">Binomial</a> for purchase times: it should figure out the most appropriate model for lag between test drive and purchase.<br /><br />Did I mention the scale? This system should be rolled out to every dealer in North America, and every salesperson on duty will be using it. How many dealers are there? I think you answered that question in your job interview, didn't you?<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">Well?</span><br /><br />Does business programming have to <a href="http://raganwald.github.com/2006/09/just-in-time-for-labour-day.html">suck</a>?<div style="clear:both; padding-bottom:0.25em"></div><p class="blogger-labels">Labels: <a rel='tag' href="http://raganwald.github.com/labels/popular.html">popular</a></p>&nbsp;
