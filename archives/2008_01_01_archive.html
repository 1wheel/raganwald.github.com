					<a href="http://raganwald.github.com/2008/01/david-heinemeier-hansson-step-aside.html" title="permanent link">David Heinemeier Hansson step aside, Paul Graham is next to be voted off the island</a></span>
					<div style="clear:both;"></div>Well, you recall my mentioning how <a href="http://raganwald.github.com/2008/01/ruby-is-soooooo-2002.html" title="Ruby is soooooo 2002">real life is a lot like high school</a>. The latest manifestation of this is an &#8220;Arc backlash.&#8221; In case you haven&#8217;t seen it, <a href="http://arclanguage.org/" title="Arc Forum | Arc">Arc</a> is a programming language designed by Paul Graham and (I think) Robert Morris. Actually, it&#8217;s a Lisp dialect, so in some respect, you can probably claim that it isn&#8217;t a new language at all, just Paul and Robert doing what Lisp programmers have always done.<br /><br />Now technically, there is not much to Arc at the moment. The language&#8217;s own site admits as much:<br /><br /><blockquote>The current version compiles into MzScheme and structurally is as much a skin on MzScheme as a separate language.</blockquote><br />So, what we have here is someone who promotes the language in his essays, then releases a version that fails to transmute lead into gold. And immediately, there was much rejoicing. Seriously, I said <strong>rejoicing</strong>. There is a distinct tone of schadenfreude to the commentary that is going around. There is much talk of people being &#8220;disappointed,&#8221; but I have a felling these folks complaining would have had no interest in trying Arc no matter what form it took. I have read the argument that expectations for Arc were high. What does that mean, exactly? That there were people holding off on trying a new language because they were waiting for Arc? Has Paul spread FUD to prevent people from using Scala or Haskell?<br /><br />Why aren&#8217;t people shrugging their shoulders? Honestly, if you don&#8217;t have any career or business capital invested in Arc, what could you possibly care about whether it is more or less than what you imagined it might be?<br /><br />The response to Arc reminds me very much of the alleged &#8220;Ruby on Rails backlash.&#8221; Quite a bit of the energy behind the RoR backlash is resentment against David Heinemeier Hansson for daring to promote his web development framework. Stepping forward and aggressively attempting to change the world is something we humans claim to admire, but we have complicated rules for how you are supposed to go about it. We want more <a href="http://woz.org">Steve Wozniak</a>, less Steve Jobs. We want people who blink in surprise at the TV cameras and the limelight of fame, not people who seek it out.<br /><br />It&#8217;s easy to understand why. Although we seem to have complex motivations&#8212;some of us after technical mastery, some of us after money, some of us after sexual partners, some of us after land holdings&#8212;most of what we do can be traced to standing within our social group. We are social animals, and almost everything we do is connected to the complexities of aligning ourselves with some folks and distancing ourselves from others in our tribes. Although I dislike the show, I would offer Survivor as being a true mirror of human nature. We spend most of our time voting each other off the island.<br /><br />Live the early stages of Survivor, we play a complex game where we have to think about both our overall welfare and also about our standing within the tribe. The shy, quiet genius who invents things we can use without promoting himself is an asset to us. He helps our tribe in battles against other tribes without jeopardizing our own standing in the tribe. Whereas the self-appointed hero may indeed help our tribe, but in doing so he vaults ahead of us.<br /><br />That&#8217;s why <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yukihiro_Matsumoto" title="Yukihiro Matsumoto - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia">Matz</a> is so well-regarded: he is quiet and unassuming. His behaviour poses no threat to our own place on the ladder. Whereas David is eager to step forward and change the world. His technical contribution to the world of Ruby is at least as valuable as the creation of the language itself, and it is not obvious to me that the world of Ruby would benefit if David hadn&#8217;t vigourously promoted Rails. But nevertheless, we are eager to see David &#8220;cut down to size,&#8221; just as we criticize Steve Jobs while praising Woz.<br /><br />Which brings me back round to Arc. Paul&#8217;s behaviour is now drawing the inevitable response. I personally think it is almost irrelevant how much technical strength the language may have had, there has been a noticeable anti-Paul tone on many programmer forums for quite some time. And what is at the root of it all? Resentment against what some people think is relentless self-promotion.<sup><font size="1">1</font></sup> Resentment against his occupying a place above us on the nerd social ladder.<br /><br />I don&#8217;t think there&#8217;s anything wrong with feeling that way, if you choose. We are humans, and it is folly to pretend otherwise. Social behaviour matters. But if that&#8217;s what it is, let&#8217;s &#8220;Call a spade a spade&#8221; and not pretend that we are disappointed with Arc. Let&#8217;s be up front and say that we are angry with Paul for daring to elbow us aside on his climb up the ladder. Let&#8217;s admit that we want to be the admired one.<br /><br />And let&#8217;s admit that even if Arc had cured cancer, we would still resent Paul. It&#8217;s just that we would have been forced to bide our time, to wait for him to stumble on something else. Just as we are still waiting for Apple&#8217;s stock to fall and for Rails to fade into obscurity.<br /><br /><hr/><br /><ol><li>That sentance originally read &ldquo;Paul&rsquo;s relentless self-promotion.&rdquo; I wrote that as a reflection on what people <em>perceived</em> to be the case, but I should have been more explicit, thus my edit. Paul challenged this. Paul is an essayist, he distributes his ideas and, in a sense, promotes the ideas and not himself. That is very true. It is also true that David promotes Rails and Steve Jobs promotes iPods. The perception of a large number of people&mdash;and this article is about those people, not about Paul specifically&mdash; is that promoting your ideas is exactly the same thing as promoting yourself. These things are not particularly rational.</li></ol><div style="clear:both; padding-bottom:0.25em"></div>&nbsp;

					<a href="http://raganwald.github.com/2008/01/apple-is-hardware-company.html" title="permanent link">Apple is in the hardware business</a></span>
					<div style="clear:both;"></div>I admit, <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/001044.html" title="Coding Horror: Why Doesn't Anyone Give a Crap About Freedom Zero?">I don&#8217;t fully understand where Jeff is coming from</a> when he says &ldquo;When you buy a new Mac, you're buying a giant hardware dongle that allows you to run OS X software.&rdquo;<br /><br />Apple is not in the operating system business. Apple is in the hardware business. Steve Jobs famously said that Apple views itself as a software company. And indeed, they do a great job of writing software. But nevertheless, they are in the hardware business: that&rsquo;s where they get the overwhelming majority of their revenues.<br /><br />Put in that light, the licensing restrictions on the operating systems that come pre-installed on their hardware are exactly the same as the licensing restrictions on the operating systems that come pre-installed in Windows PCs from manufacturers like <a href="http://finance.yahoo.com/q/bc?s=AAPL&t=5y&l=on&z=m&q=l&c=SNE,DELL" title="AAPL: Basic Chart for APPLE INC - Yahoo! Finance">Dell and Sony</a>.<br /><br /><blockquote>It is appropriate to lambaste Apple for selling their product—hardware—with a non-free OS pre-installed. However, they offer the exact same Freedom Zero as the PCs you can buy from Dell.</blockquote><br />Arguing that we ought to be able to install OS X on a white box PC is analogous to arguing that we ought to be able to purchase a Sony Vaio, then take the OEM copy of Windows off the laptop and install it on a white box laptop. Or that we ought to be able to purchase an <em>upgrade</em> copy of Windows and install it on a white box PC. I say upgrade copy, because the standalone copies of OS X for sale are licensed for upgrades only, not for new machines.<br /><br />People who think of the argument as being <a href="http://finance.yahoo.com/q/bc?t=5y&amp;s=AAPL&amp;l=on&amp;z=m&amp;q=l&amp;c=MSFT" title="No Ticker Symbol - Yahoo! Finance">Apple vs. Microsoft</a> think of the two companies as being in the OS business. But Apple is not in the OS business, and hasn&#8217;t been in that business since Jobs returned and quickly killed the OEM Macintosh market. Think of an <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000JNYWBG?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=raganwald001-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B000JNYWBG">iPod touch</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=raganwald001-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=B000JNYWBG" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />. Would anybody argue that when you buy an iPod you are buying a copy of OS X with a dongle that happens to play music attached to it? Seriously? is anybody complaining that they can&#8217;t transfer their copy of OS X from an iPod touch to whatever <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000WG6XW6?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=raganwald001-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B000WG6XW6">lame music player</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=raganwald001-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=B000WG6XW6" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" /> Microsoft is peddling this week?<br /><br /><div class="book"><hr/><br /><a id="lnx0" name="evtst|a|0596007191" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0596007191?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=raganwald001-20&amp;link_code=as3&amp;camp=211189&amp;creative=373489&amp;creativeASIN=0596007191"><img style="cursor: pointer;" src="http://raganwald.github.com/uploaded_images/revolution_in_the_valley-742074.jpg" alt="" border="0"></a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=raganwald001-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=0596007191" alt="" style="border: medium none  ! important; margin: 0px ! important;" border="0" height="1" width="1"><br /><br /><a id="lnx1" name="evtst|a|0596007191" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0596007191?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=raganwald001-20&amp;link_code=as3&amp;camp=211189&amp;creative=373489&amp;creativeASIN=0596007191">Revolution in the Valley</a> tells the incredible story of the creation of the Macintosh—from the perspectives of the people who were actually there. It’s packed with behind-the-scenes anecdotes and little-known secrets. Much of the material is available on line <a href="http://folklore.org">for free</a>.<br /><hr/></div>A dongle exists to prevent you from using a piece of software twice without paying for it twice. Apple is hardly even trying to prevent you from using OS X twice without paying for it twice. I can demonstrate this for you: I have a copy of Leopard. There is no copy protection on it. It does not phone home. Why is that? Ah! It is because it is only supposed to run on Apple hardware. Exactly. If Apple lose a few sales of Leopard to Macintosh owners that illegally copy Leopard, that is too bad but it is no big deal to them. Of course, if you <a title="Build a Hackintosh Mac for Under $800" href="http://lifehacker.com/software/hack-attack/build-a-hackintosh-mac-for-under-800-321913.php">hack it to run on non-Apple hardware</a>, you are going to wind up on a first-name basis with Apple&rsquo;s lawyers. That&#8217;s because&#8212;are you tired of hearing me say this?&#8212;they are in the hardware business, not the operating system business.<br /><br />In that light, it is appropriate to lambaste them for selling their product&#8212;hardware&#8212;with a non-free OS pre-installed. However, they offer the exact same Freedom Zero as the PCs you can buy from Dell. You can modify them without incurring Apple&#8217;s wrath. You can install another operating system on them, even Windows. It&#8217;s true that their hardware is bundled with non-free software, and that&#8217;s too bad. But the product they sell&#8212;hardware&#8212;is free of encumbrances. If you want to compare and contrast them, compare them to another hardware company Dell: In addition to selling hardware with non-free operating systems, Dell also sells <a href="http://www.dell.com/content/topics/global.aspx/alliances/en/linux?c=us&amp;cs=555&amp;l=en&amp;s=biz" title="Dell and Linux">hardware with Linux pre-installed</a>. <br /><br />I could end this with a cheap shot about Microsoft only selling non-free products, but I won&#8217;t. I can&rsquo;t. The point here is that comparing Apple to Microsoft is almost completely meaningless in this context, because Apple is a company in the hardware business that happens develop and bundle an insanely great&mdash;but non-free&mdash;OS with their hardware.<div style="clear:both; padding-bottom:0.25em"></div>&nbsp;

					<div style="clear:both;"></div>Thanks for your call. I can pull your interview evaluation right up on my screen. Let me see now, home&#8230;, candidates&#8230;, search candidates&#8230;, click the last name field&#8230;, clickity clickety&#8230;, <em>search</em>. Sorry, wrong, I put your full name in the last name field, let me try again&#8230;, search candidates&#8230;, click the last name field&#8230;, clickity clickety&#8230;, <em>search</em>. Sorry about the wait, it&#8217;s too bad finding someone in our application is so <a href="http://raganwald.github.com/2007/09/we-have-lost-control-of-apparatus.html" title="We have lost control of the apparatus">clunky</a>. Ok, here&#8217;s your evaluation, I&#8217;m looking at it right now.<br /><br />I&#8217;m sorry, I don&#8217;t have good news abut the job opening here at BigCo. We have elected to pass on bringing you in for another interview.<br /><br />Yes, I can appreciate that you are disappointed. You&#8217;re right, you have <a href="http://raganwald.github.com/2005/07/why-you-need-degree-to-work-for-bigco.html" title="Why You Need a Degree to Work For BigCo">the right kind of degree from the right kind of University</a>, and you have excellent grades. But still, we are going to bring some of the other candidates in for another round of talks.<br /><br /><blockquote>We know that you will never need to understand recursion to do things here. In fact, we will probably fire anyone who writes higher-order functional code in our Java applications.</blockquote><br /><!--<div align="center"><img src="http://raganwald.github.com/uploaded_images/resume.png" border="0" hsize="500" vsize="359"/></div><br />-->Why? Well, you seem like a nice person, so I will break our policy and tell you the actual reason. It was because you blew the recursion and data structures code tests. That&#8217;s it, really. You passed the database stuff and the loop stuff and the web architecture stuff just fine. As well as anybody might. But the recursion and data structures tests are kind of important. If we didn&#8217;t think so, we wouldn&#8217;t ask those questions.<br /><br />Yes, we know that recursion doesn&#8217;t come up often in business applications. It&#8217;s been a while since I needed it for anything, these days we use XPath and SQL and let libraries do all of the dirty work for us. That&#8217;s true. And you&#8217;re right, we always use libraries and never write our own data structures. This is BigCo, not some sushi-gobbling start up. But we still ask you these questions, and we still expect you to get them right if you want to work here.<br /><br />Are you asking why <em>again</em>? I feel like I&#8217;m talking to my three year-old here. But you obviously put a lot of work into researching our company before coming in for the interviews, you really stood out from the crowd of new graduates, and nobody else had the gumption to follow up with a phone call, I feel I owe you one.<br /><br />The reason we expect you to know these things is that they were subjects you claim to have studied when you got your Computer Science degree. Don&#8217;t argue with me, I know that Universities are getting a lot more &#8220;practical&#8221; these days, <a href="http://raganwald.github.com/2008/01/no-disrespect.html" title="No Disrespect">we like that</a>. I know that you learned your stuff in Java instead of in Scheme or&#8212;and this would make you instantly unemployable here at BigCo&#8212;in Haskell. But they still teach you about recursion. They still teach you about data structures. You are supposed to graduate knowing how to reverse a linked list, how to find the shortest distance between two nodes in a graph, how to search a tree, and what&#8217;s involved in finding cycles in a graph.<br /><br />I know, if it were up to us they wouldn&#8217;t waste time teaching you stuff we don&#8217;t want you to use every day. But until we finish making programming a level playing field with the Third World, they are going to keep teaching some of that stuff and you are supposed to learn it. We didn&#8217;t ask you anything really tricky, we just asked you to regurgitate stuff you ought to have learned.<br /><br /><strong>Laziness</strong><br /><br />Harumph. really? You really knew it but forgot it because you didn&#8217;t think you&#8217;d need it here? Well, let me be blunt: <em>you were lazy</em>. You tried to optimize your time to spend as little as possible on the things that you thought we wouldn&#8217;t ask you to know. You tried to maximize your grades by taking the easiest courses possible, so you didn&#8217;t get much of that stuff.<br /><br />You were lazy. Now, <a href="http://xahlee.org/UnixResource_dir/writ/perl_laziness.html" title="Laziness, Perl, and Larry Wall">laziness is said to be a virtue in a programmer</a>. And if you want to be one of those super-smart programmers who can tell me why the only birds you need are <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0192801422?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=raganwald001-20&amp;link_code=as3&amp;camp=211189&amp;creative=373489&amp;creativeASIN=0192801422" title="Amazon.com: To Mock a Mockingbird by Raymond M. Smullyan">Starlings and Kestrels</a>, you might start a company that we buy for big bucks. But quite honestly, we don&#8217;t appreciate laziness in someone we are hiring to toil away in the bowels of our enterprise application code.<br /><br /><blockquote>Quite honestly, we don&#8217;t appreciate laziness in someone we are hiring to toil away in the bowels of our enterprise application code.</blockquote><br />Ok, stop, stop, I am not finished. Of <em>course</em> we know that you will almost never need to deeply understand recursion to do things here. And if you need it, you can Google around for some code to cut and paste. In fact, we will probably fire anyone who writes a lot of that <a href="http://raganwald.github.com/2007/01/closures-and-higher-order-functions.html" title="Closures and Higher-Order Functions<br />">higher-order functional</a> code in our Java applications. We know that. But you know what else we know? We know you took shortcuts in school, you did just enough to get through without actually learning anything about the stuff you figured you didn&#8217;t need to get a job here.<br /><br />Which makes us worried about what else you skipped to get here. We can&#8217;t test everything, we have to assume that if you skipped that stuff, you might have skipped something else. We have to assume that if you took short cuts to get here, you&#8217;ll take short cuts after we hire you. Maybe you&#8217;ll decide to push code into production without testing it thoroughly. Maybe you&#8217;ll decide to pretend to review someone else&#8217;s code but you won&#8217;t find an obvious error because you were too lazy to read it carefully.<br /><br />There you go interrupting me again.<br /><br />Yes of course we sometimes push code into production without as much testing as we like. But you know what? <em>We</em> want to make those decisions. We don&#8217;t want our newly hired, wet-behind-the-ears juniors being lazy and making those decisions for us. We want to hire people that are thorough and meticulous and always do everything they are told by us, and by their professors in University.<br /><br />The bottom line is this: we appreciate your interest, but there is no room for laziness in our evaluation. We&#8217;re looking for people who put their heads down and do what they&#8217;re told without trying to game the system. <em>We</em> play the game. <em>You</em> are supposed to be the pawn, and if we let you survive to reach the eighth rank, you might get a chance to play along. But nobody needs a lazy pawn, sorry.<br /><br />Best of luck with your job search, better luck next time.<br /><br /><hr/><br /><em>Update: Finally, someone sided with the hapless and much-maligned candidate</em><br /><br /><blockquote>To expect someone to know a skill which is not going to be needed on the job is unfair.</blockquote><div>&mdash;Brandon on news.ycombinator.com</div><br />First, remember that an employer is talking to dozens or even hundreds of candidates. This one knows everything they anticipate is needed for the job, that one knows all of those things and more: which one should the employer hire?<br /><br />Second, forget a Computer Science degree for a moment. You are interviewing a programmer who has just graduated with a degree in something unrelated, say English. You ask him whether he studied Shakespeare. He did. Does he remember any of it? Why no, he was just taking the course to get a degree, he didn&rsquo;t pay attention beyond passing his examination. Is it unfair to pass over this person because they didn&rsquo;t actually do any learning in College, just doing whatever they needed to do to pass courses and accumulate credits? I think this is a behaviour that&mdash;if repeated on the job&mdash; is deleterious.<br /><br />As an employer, I do not select a candidate&rsquo;s University. I do not select their courses. I do not choose the coursework and study material. The candidate does all of that. Am I unfair to say to the candidate that whatever they choose to study, they ought to actually learn it?<br /><br />Putting it in harsher terms, when a candidate puts a degree on their r&eacute;sum&eacute;, they are making a claim. Are they claiming that they did just enough to obtain the required marks and no more, or are they claiming to know the material that was taught to them? If it is the latter, then as an employer I am being perfectly fair in testing their claims, whether or not the material has direct relevance to their initial job assignment.<div style="clear:both; padding-bottom:0.25em"></div>&nbsp;

					<div style="clear:both;"></div>Reddit is now experimenting with user-generated reddits, and one of the new ones is <a href="http://ruby.reddit.com">reddit for ruby hackers</a>. For the three people who have never heard of reddit, this is a link aggregation site where you can vote on ruby articles, something like Digg and Dzone.<br /><br /><a href="http://ruby.reddit.com"><img hsize="500" vszie="415" src="http://raganwald.github.com/uploaded_images/ruby.reddit.com.png" border="0"/></a><br /><br />The Ruby reddit is important, and if you patronize link aggregators like this, I encourage you to please post good Ruby links, vote for the links you like, and perhaps even participate in the comments.<br /><br />There is already a programming subreddit, but the Ruby reddit is appears to be an entirely distinct &ldquo;space.&rdquo; Posts can be in programming.reddit com and in ruby.reddit.com, and there are separate posts and comments. What this means is that Ruby programmers can vote for links and exchange comments without getting into tiresome flame-wars with people who do not care for Ruby.<br /><br />Of course, you are still free to defend Ruby against Smug Haskell Weenies over in programming.reddit.com. It isn&rsquo;t an all-or-nothing choice. I look forward to seeing you there!<div style="clear:both; padding-bottom:0.25em"></div><p class="blogger-labels">Labels: <a rel='tag' href="http://raganwald.github.com/labels/ruby.html">ruby</a></p>&nbsp;

					<div style="clear:both;"></div>At <a href="http://www.mcommons.com/jobs.html" title="Mobile Commons - Jobs">Mobile Commons</a>, we have to write a lot of code under time constraints. We also work on a fairly distributed basis, which means that writing readable code is not a luxury, it&#8217;s a necessity. We can&#8217;t afford to be clever for clever&#8217;s sake, but if a new idiom helps make our code easier for our colleagues to grasp in a hurry, we embrace it. Here&#8217;re some idioms we&#8217;ve recently created:<br /><br /><strong>Object#andand</strong><br /><br />Ruby programmers are familiar with the two <em>guarded assignment</em> operators <code>&amp;&amp;=</code> and <code>||=</code>. The typical use for them is when you have a variable that might be nil. For example:<br /><pre><code><br />@first_name &amp;&amp;= @first_name.trim<br />@phone ||= '612-777-9311'</code></pre><br />You are trimming the first name provided it isn&#8217;t nil, and you are assigning &#8216;612-777-9311&#8217; to the phone if it <em>is</em> nil (or false, but that isn&#8217;t important right now). The other day we were discussing the guards and we agreed that we wished there was a <em>guarded method invocation</em> operator. Here&#8217;s an example of when you would use it:<br /><pre><code><br />@phone = Location.find(:first, ...elided... )&amp;&amp;.phone</code></pre><br />Meaning, search the location table for the first record matching some criteria, and if you find a location, get its phone. If you don&#8217;t, get nil. (Groovy provides this exact functionality, although Groovy uses <code>?.</code> instead of <code>&amp;&amp;.</code>) However, <code>&amp;&amp;.</code> won&#8217;t work because <code>&amp;&amp;.</code> is not a real Ruby operator. So what do we write instead?<br /><blockquote>A feature is &ldquo;powerful&rdquo; when at least one of the following holds:<br /><ol><li> It can be used to implement something trivial in an pointlessly complicated way.</li><li>It can cause a lot of damage.</li></ol>Seriously, it seems like 85% percents of the contexts where something is called &ldquo;powerful,&rdquo; it really means &ldquo;useless and dangerous.&rdquo;</blockquote><div>&mdash;Yossi Kreinin, <a href="http://www.yosefk.com/blog/?p=16">Fun at the Turing Tar Pit</a></div><br />How about:<br /><pre><code><br />@phone = (loc = Location.find(:first, ...elided... )) &amp;&amp; loc.phone</code></pre><br />Note that we need a local variable to make it work without extending the Object class. Note further that although we only need the local variable for one line of code, it is in method scope and we must be careful that we don&#8217;t clobber an existing <code>loc</code> variable. And when reading this code, we now have to look and see whether <code>loc</code> is used again to understand what this line does.<br /><br />This is a scoping problem. if you are going to use variables, you want to restrict their scope as much as possible. It feels like half of what we do when programming is manage side effects like overwriting a variable you are using elsewhere, and the more you can restrict those side effects, the easier programming becomes. Java supports block scoping natively, and languages like Scheme solve this by providing a block scope macro, <code>let</code>. And you can roll your own in languages like <a href="http://raganwald.github.com/2007/08/block-structured-javascript.html" title="Block-Structured Javascript">Javascript</a> that provide anonymous functions. But this seems to get <a href="http://raganwald.github.com/2008/01/no-detail-too-small.html" title="No Detail Too Small">the natural left-to-right order</a> wrong:<br /><pre><code><br />@phone = lambda { |loc| loc &amp;&amp; loc.phone }.call(Location.find(:first, ...elided... ))</code></pre><br />Well, we are tinkerers and toolsmiths. So let&#8217;s roll our own. We can&#8217;t use <code>&amp;&amp;.</code> without rewriting the Ruby parser, and that seems drastic. So let&#8217;s use &#8220;andand&#8221; in the hope that our non-English-speaking colleagues will forgive us. We want to write:<br /><pre><code><br />@phone = Location.find(:first, ...elided... ).andand.phone</code></pre><br />And get the same effect as <code>@phone = -&gt;(loc){ loc &amp;&amp; loc.phone }.call(Location.find(:first, ...elided... ))</code>. This would be bloody trivial if we have a macro facility, but &#8220;If wishes were horses then beggars would ride.&#8221; Instead, we need to write a method that does some conditional evaluation for us. If the receiver (in this case the result of <code>Location.find(:first, ...elided... )</code>) is truthy, like an ActiveRecord model, we want <code>andand</code> to return it so we can use it. But if it is falsy, we want <code>andand</code> to somehow return something that takes any message you send it and returns itself without doing anything. In other words, we want a mock object of sorts. So that&#8217;s what we&#8217;ll do:<br /><pre><code><br />class Object<br />    def andand (p = nil)<br />      self or MockReturningMe.new(self)<br />    end<br />end<br /><br />class MockReturningMe<br />  instance_methods.reject { |m| m =~ /^__/ }.each { |m| undef_method m }<br />  def initialize(me)<br />    @me = me<br />  end<br />  def method_missing(*args)<br />    @me<br />  end<br />end</code></pre><br /><em><font size="-1">Actually, there is more to it than this, for example the MockReturningMe class is enclosed in a module to minimize namespace pollution. Consult the source and RSpec (links below) for the latest particulars</font></em>.<br /><br />Note that because you accept any method using Ruby&rsquo;s method invocation syntax, you can accept methods with parameters and/or blocks:<br /><pre><code><br />list_of_lists.detect { ...elided... }.andand.inject(42) { ...elided ... }</code></pre><br />Some of the other solutions to this problem that use <code>send</code> change Ruby&rsquo;s syntax. This solution emphasizes syntactic regularity: the goal was to make an &ldquo;&&.&rdquo; operation that worked like &&=. &&= looks just like normal assignment, you can use any expression on the RHS, only the semantics are different. The andand method also works just like a normal method invocation, only the semantics are modified.<br /><br /><strong>Enhanced Object#tap</strong><br /><br />(Formerly called Object#me)<br /><br />Ruby 1.9 includes <a href="http://blog.moertel.com/articles/2007/02/07/ruby-1-9-gets-handy-new-method-object-tap">Object#tap</a>:<br /><pre><code><br />Location.find(:first, ...elided... ) do |location|<br />    puts location.inspect<br />end<br />   =&gt; location</code></pre><br />Ruby On Rails includes a similar feature, the <em>returning</em> idiom:<br /><pre><code><br />returning(Location.find(:first, ...elided... )) do |location|<br />    ...elided...<br />end<br />   =&gt; location</code></pre><br />Both return the location, not whatever happens inside the block. This is very useful, especially when chaining methods in a pipeline. Sometimes you want to do something for side effects, but continue on with the chain. For example:<br /><pre><code><br />returning([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]) do |arr|<br />    arr.pop<br />end.map { |n| n * 2 }<br />    =&gt; [2, 4, 6, 8]</code></pre><br />There are going to be times that using a method instead of a function makes the code more consistent. So let&#8217;s imagine what that would look like:<br /><pre><code><br />Location.find(:first, ...elided... ).tap do |location|<br />    ...elided...<br />end&hellip;</code></pre><br />This is much nicer when you are &ldquo;injecting&rdquo; some extra code into the middle of an expression, such as when adding some poor-man&rsquo;s-debugging puts statements.<br /><br />Would we ever want to go beyond a block and write <code>Location.find(:first, ...elided... ).tap.some_method</code> instead of <code>Location.find(:first, ...elided... ).tap do ...elided... end</code>? Of course we would! Quite often, we want to send several methods to the same receiver. In Smalltalk, the semicolon does this explicitly. In Ruby, we have to be very careful to make sure our methods return <em>self</em> to enable chaining. For example:<br /><pre><code><br />[1, 2, 3] &lt;&lt; 4 &lt;&lt; 5<br />    =&gt; [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]</code></pre><br />But if a method doesn&#8217;t return the receiver, chaining doesn&#8217;t work. That&#8217;s why we had to use &#8220;returning&#8221; in the array example above:<br /><pre><code><br />[1, 2, 3, 4, 5].pop.map { |n| n * 2 }<br />    =&gt; NoMethodError: undefined method `map' for 5:Fixnum</code></pre><br />That&#8217;s because <code>[1, 2, 3, 4, 5].pop =&gt; 5</code>, not <code>[1, 2, 3, 4]</code>. So instead, we write:<br /><pre><code><br />[1, 2, 3, 4, 5].tap.pop.map { |n| n * 2 }<br />    =&gt; [2, 4, 6, 8]     # or we write...<br />[1, 2, 3, 4, 5].tap { |arr| arr.pop }.map { |n| n * 2 }<br />    =&gt; [2, 4, 6, 8]     # both work</code></pre><br />When you examine the source, you&#8217;ll see that <em>tap</em> looks a lot like <em>andand</em>. No surprise, we are doing similar things with slightly different semantics.<br /><br />This implementation of Object#tap has two advantages over the implementation in Ruby 1.9: first, it works in Ruby 1.8. Second, it adds the ability to call another method (like <code>pop</code>) and not have to include a block.<br /><br /><strong>Summary: andand &amp; enhanced tap</strong><br /><br /><em>andand</em> and <em>tap</em> both provide the same two benefits: First, they either eliminate (in the case of a method call) or limit in scope (in the case of a block) a local variable. Second, they let you maintain a natural left-to-right order when writing pipelined expressions. They are simple and obvious enough that I feel any unfamiliarity for the reader will be more than outweighed by the cleaner, easier-to-digest code that results from their liberal use.<br /><br />My suggestion is that these two benefits make it worth your while to add these methods to the Object class and use them regularly in your code.<br /><br /><strong>Installation</strong><br /><br /><code>sudo gem install andand</code>.

Obviously, it works for many of the cases you want to try, and you don&rsquo;t need to add a new method to Object. However, it is&mdash;to paraphrase <a href="http://chalain.livejournal.com/39332.html">Chalain</a>&mdash;&ldquo;Sneaking up on the Interpreter.&rdquo;<br /><br />It achieves what we want almost by accident, namely that it rescues <code>NoMethodError</code>, which by co&iuml;ncidence gives us the result we want. However, it does not communicate our intent. It says that we want to transmute all exceptions into a value of <code>nil</code>. When someone glances at the code, will they think of <code>NoMethodError</code>? Or will they assume that we are trying to handle exceptions that the <code>.phone</code> method might throw?<br />  <br />And what if <code>.phone</code> actually throws something serious? In Rails, what happens if a migration is screwed up and there is no phone column? I think we actually want a <code>NoMethodError</code> in that case. The rescue clause will accidentally swallow the exceptions we are trying to catch.<br /><br />I think if you are absolutely certain that you do not care about other exceptions and also if your team uses this idiom extensively so that it does not miscommunicate its intent, you can live a long and happy life using it. However, I would be hesitant to recommend it as a general-purpose solution. <em>andand</em> and some of the other solutions obviously require the code reader to learn a new method name, but after that they offer the exact functionality we need and clearly communicate their intent.<div style="clear:both; padding-bottom:0.25em"></div><p class="blogger-labels">Labels: <a rel='tag' href="http://raganwald.github.com/labels/ruby.html">ruby</a></p>&nbsp;

Ignorance of those tools is not helpful. I think you will be <em>even better</em> with more knowledge. I think you will be <em>happier</em> if you learn how to &ldquo;cut with the grain&rdquo; and work with the principles of software development instead of against them. But even if you decide you can&rsquo;t be bothered with anything hard, the important thing is that you write programs, therefore you are a programmer.<br /><br />I don&rsquo;t want to wake up one day and find there&rsquo;s a required reading course for being a programmer (even if my blog is on the list).

No. I will be the first to say that compilers and language implementation are important. I will rant.<br /><br />I support your individual choice of what to learn and what to skip as a programmer. Agree or disagree with me, I say you&rsquo;re a programmer and I measure how good you are by what you do with the knowledge you decide to acquire.

Programming languages also have huge scope for Design: designing a notation for programs is an exercise in applied psychology, an exercise in influencing the thoughts and behaviour of the programmer.<br /><br />A recent article accused the MapReduce algorithm of lacking novelty, of using forty year-old ideas. For a Scientist, this is a problem: Scientists wake up in the morning trying to move the world forward. But for a software developer, using a forty year-old idea ought to be the normal case. Is it Engineering? Is it Science? Maybe it is <em>Damn Useful</em>, and maybe the non-Engineer, non-Scientist measures themselves against that yardstick.<br /><br />I don&rsquo;t have a tidy conclusion for you: just a suggestion that you read the linked post and ask yourself what you really want to do with your talent and your life, be it Engineering, Science, Design, or making software that enriches people&rsquo;s lives.<br /><br />Then go out and do it.<br /><br /><em>Update</em>: Are you a Doctor?<br /><br /><blockquote>To come up with a proper treatment, doctors need to have an exact diagnosis. To have an exact diagnosis, doctors need to know exactly what is going on in the body. And the only way they can do that is to have a total and complete understanding of how the body works. They can&rsquo;t just skimp out and decide &ldquo;Oh, the circulatory system&rsquo;s not that important.&rdquo; They can&rsquo;t just say &ldquo;Heart trouble? Here, have some aspirin.&rdquo; Sure, the aspirin might stop the pain temporarily, but in the long run, the patient will suffer even more, and probably die.</blockquote><div>&mdash;<a href="http://www.simmoril.com/blog/?p=281">If It&rsquo;s Worth Having, It&rsquo;s Worth Working Hard For</a></div><div style="clear:both; padding-bottom:0.25em"></div>&nbsp;

					<div style="clear:both;"></div>I first heard about Ruby when Matz spoke at LL2 in <a title="Where were you on Saturday, November 9, 2002?" href="http://raganwald.github.com/2007/01/where-were-you-on-saturday-november-9.html">November, 2002</a>. I experimented with it on and off over the next few years, and I liked it. I also experimented with C#, Groovy, and a few others, but Ruby reminded me of Smalltalk, a language I used in the 80s and loved, so I stuck with it even though I seemed to be one of three people using Ruby without using Rails.<br /><br />Lately, the internet echo chamber is souring on Ruby and moving from embracing it to hating it. I suspect that although people are quoting all sorts of technical reasons for their dislike, it comes down to cultural forces. Shrug.<br /><br />I am reminded of the time I showed up in high school one September on a skateboard. To give you an idea of where skateboards were in those days, my model had clay wheels designed for wood-rink roller-skates, not the polyurethane we have today. Any ways, everyone laughed at me. The next Summer, everyone had one, and they were laughing at the fact that I didn't ride the latest model, even though I was a more accomplished free-styler and slalom rider. Then, the fad passed, and I was the iconoclast again, still riding my board while everyone embraced mopeds.<br /><br />Guess what? There is no villain in the story. I was happy riding with my friends. The people who jumped on and off fads were happy, and they were learning important life skills about participating in human culture. And the fad was a big win: Early boards really weren&rsquo;t very good, and the popularity brought money and manufacturing scale to skateboarding that improved the technology.<br /><br />Paul Graham has said that the real world is nothing like high school. I&rsquo;m not so sure.<br /><br /><hr/><br /><em>I often use Ruby for code examples. What do you think: Should I continue using Ruby, or should I use another language for examples? If I continue using Ruby, should I try to show idiomatic Ruby or should I try to focus on general ideas that can be applied elsewhere?</em><br /><br /><form method=post action="http://poll.pollcode.com/Zp91"><table border=0 width=150 bgcolor="FFCC00" cellspacing=0 cellpadding=2><tr><td colspan=2><font face="Verdana" size=-1 color="000000"><b>Code examples should be:</b></font></td></tr><tr><td width=5><input type=radio name=answer value="1"></td><td><font face="Verdana" size=-1 color="000000">Ruby-specific</font></td></tr><tr><td width=5><input type=radio name=answer value="2"></td><td><font face="Verdana" size=-1 color="000000">Anything but Ruby</font></td></tr><tr><td width=5><input type=radio name=answer value="3"></td><td><font face="Verdana" size=-1 color="000000">Ruby, but general</font></td></tr><tr><td width=5><input type=radio name=answer value="4"></td><td><font face="Verdana" size=-1 color="000000">A mix of specific and general ideas</font></td></tr><tr><td colspan=2><center><input type=submit value="Vote">&nbsp;&nbsp;<input type=submit name=view value="View"></center></td></tr><tr><td bgcolor="white" colspan=2 align=right><font face="Verdana" size=-2 color="black">pollcode.com <a href=http://pollcode.com/><font color="navy">free polls</font></a></font></td></tr></table></form><div style="clear:both; padding-bottom:0.25em"></div><p class="blogger-labels">Labels: <a rel='tag' href="http://raganwald.github.com/labels/ruby.html">ruby</a></p>&nbsp;

					<div style="clear:both;"></div><blockquote>It&#8217;s like if you walked into a painting class, told everyone that learning to paint was too hard, and then gave everyone a camera and told them that photography was the same thing as painting, only a lot easier to do. No disrespect towards photographers intended.</blockquote><div>&#8212;<a href="http://www.ekinoderm.com/wordpress/?p=27">Who did Kill the Software Engineer?</a></div><br /><br />I hear an argument that business programming isn&rsquo;t hard. It does not require understanding combinatorial logic and fixed points. There is no value in knowing how to program in OCaml (or why that might be a good idea). Business programming is <em>practical</em>, and business programmers need practical training to do a practical job.<br /><br />Ok, I&rsquo;ll bite. Really. As Keith would say, I&rsquo;ll climb down from my former position on this. Fine. So here&rsquo;s my question to you, Mr. &ldquo;An undergraduate Computer Science program ought to be as easy as business programming:&rdquo;<br /><br />Why don&rsquo;t businesses advertise for vocational college graduates?<br /><br />You are describing a vocational job to me. The rote application of practical principles is nothing more and nothing less. How is what you&rsquo;re describing any different than a job as an accounts receivable clerk or a dental technician? Or a land surveyor? Or a architectural draftsperson?<br /><br /><blockquote>If your comp-sci course is easy then you&rsquo;re either a genius or you&rsquo;re wasting your money. The odds on that are not in your favour.</blockquote><div>&mdash;Chris Cummer, <a href="http://www.postal-code.com/binarycode/2008/01/21/two-thoughts-on-computer-science-courses/">Two Thoughts on Computer Science Courses</a></div><br />These are all vocational jobs with a well-established and perfectly functional system for training clerks, technicians, surveyors, and draftspersons. Well? Why won&rsquo;t businesses come clean with everyone and say that&rsquo;s what they want?<br /><br />Let me tell you the cold, hard, truth. You aren&rsquo;t going to like this, but I ask you to believe me when I say that I am telling you this for your own good: <br /><br />There is a culture of pretending business programming is more than it is. Some of you calling for more Java in University may take false hope that I am on your side. You may think that the people arguing for Scheme, Haskell, and OCaml are elitists. Wrong. They do not have a problem. You are the one with a problem because you don&rsquo;t want to tell all your friends you have a job as a clerk.<br /><br /><strong>So you want to be a clerk</strong><br /><br />You do a clerk&rsquo;s job, you settle for a clerk&rsquo;s working conditions and wages, but you take solace in the thought that you are somehow more than a clerk, because <em>you have a university degree</em> and the dental technician who cleans your teeth doesn&rsquo;t.<br /><br />Only everyone knows it&rsquo;s a sham, especially the hiring manager who puts &ldquo;University degree required&rdquo; in the job advertisement. He wants to hire a clerk, someone who will work long hours doing as they&rsquo;re told in a top-down, hierarchal command structure. Does that job sound like there is any Science involved? Of course not, everyone knows that, it&rsquo;s why the industry is trying to weed all of the Science out of a Computer Science degree.<br /><br />And you&rsquo;re falling for it, hook, line, and sinker.<br /><br />The university just wants your money, they&rsquo;re selling you a gown and mortar for the low, low price of $5,836 a year (books, room, board, and other expenses not included). Business just wants to let you have your little fantasy of being a cut above the X-Ray Technician who does the same, repetitive thing all day working with a big flat screen and data that goes on a hard drive ($45,950 median salary).<br /><br /><blockquote>The sooner you figure out the game, the sooner you can start playing instead of being played.</blockquote><br />So we dumb down the curriculum. Who loses? Please don&rsquo;t tell me the University loses its reputation. They don&rsquo;t care, their budget is based on how many people like you they can con into getting a piece of paper that isn&rsquo;t really any better than a vocational college certificate. If they need any more prestige, they&rsquo;ll take your fees and give them to someone who will write a paper.<br /><br />You didn&rsquo;t write any papers, did you? The one thing that is really, really useful for getting ahead in business is learning to write, learning to speak, learning to <em>persuade</em>. If a Computer Science degree was really meant to give you an advantage in a business environment, it would involve a lot more writing English than writing Java. You would know that if you went on to get an MBA.<br /><br />Anyways, the university is doing just fine, thank you for helping to pay for a fancy new building. How about businesses? Are they losing because they're paying university degree wages for clerks? No, because the secret of business is that the market works  out the right price unless you can monopolize supply.<br /><br />And you, my friend, are not monopolizing supply. Did your university have a strict cap on the number of undergraduates entering the CompSci program? No? Then your degree has absolutely zero leverage. Wait, I could be wrong. Do businesses refuse to hire workers with foreign credentials? They <em>do</em> hire workers with foreign credentials? Well, there goes that component of value.<br /><br />Let me tell you, and I speak as a hiring manager. <em>We lie to you</em>. We write in articles and books and on blogs how much we value a degree. Joel Spolsky argues that there ought to be good degrees. But I will bet anyone $100 that he will hire a high school graduate if that graduate is smart and can get things done.<br /><br />Beyond your actual ability to write programs, a degree is only as meaningful as its scarcity. If degrees are easy to get, they mean squat. Sure, when I&rsquo;m hiring I might choose to toss all the no-experience resum&eacute;s without degrees. I&rsquo;m still left with a pile of two hundred people to interview. Do you think I&rsquo;m paying any of you top dollar when I have 199 more people to see?<br /><br />The reality is that your degree is only a pacifier, a way to make you feel good about yourself. <em>The industry is selling you the illusion of respect</em>.<br /><br />I&rsquo;m telling you this because the sooner you figure out the game, the sooner you can start playing instead of being played. If you really want to be more than a clerk, you can pay more attention to what is to be done and how much freedom you have to do it and less attention to whether there is a title or a degree involved.<br /><br />You <em>can</em> be respected for your job. But it has nothing to do with whether we pretend a university degree is required for the position. Everybody knows it isn&rsquo;t: if it was, there would be no need to dumb down the program to suit the job. Respect comes from what you accomplish, and where programs are involved, it comes from writing programs, not from a title or a piece of a paper (nor from a book or a blog). Nobody on Earth can stop you from writing software and earning genuine respect.<br /><br />So do yourself a favour. Don&rsquo;t let them play this game at your expense. Don&rsquo;t allow them to disrespect you so transparently.<br /><br />You deserve more respect than that.<br /><br />p.s. Look, there is nothing wrong with being a clerk as long as you not in denial about your job. There is nothing wrong with educational institutions helping to fulfill a demand for clerks. And although I don&rsquo;t think it is in a business&rsquo;s best interests to treat programmers as clerks, there is nothing wrong with a business making that choice.<br /><br />That being said, there are institutions that offer much more than vocational training in their undergraduate programs. Here&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s in your best interests&mdash;not business&rsquo;s best interests, but <u>your</u> best interests&mdash;to get a degree involving actual Computer Science, not vocational training: <a href="http://enfranchisedmind.com/blog/2008/01/21/what-good-is-a-cs-degree">What good is a CS degree?</a> And furthermore, there are plenty of programming careers that are an alternative to clerking. I am not going to say better or worse, just different. You don&rsquo;t have to follow that road, no matter how many others are going that way.<br /><br />The point of this post is that <em>you</em> need to have your eyes wide open when choosing what type of education you need and what type of career to pursue.<div style="clear:both; padding-bottom:0.25em"></div>&nbsp;

					<div style="clear:both;"></div>Expression-oriented programming (also known as functional or side-effect-free programming, although the three things are related, not synonymous) is a wonderful way to make calculations easier to understand and maintain. However, sometimes deeply nested function calls or mixing function calls with method invocations can make an expression difficult to understand at a glance. Here is a tip for refactoring your expressions so they are easier to read.<br /><br />Expressions naturally form a tree, with values at the leaves and function calls or method invocations at each node. In this post, I&rsquo;ll be talking about the simplest form of expression, a <em>pipeline</em>. A pipeline is an expression that does not branch: a value (or often collection of values) is transformed by two or more  function calls or method invocations in succession. Here&rsquo;s a slightly obfuscated example of a pipeline working with collections from one of <a href="http://www.mcommons.com/jobs.html" title="Mobile Commons is Hiring">our</a> Rails applications:<br /><pre><code><br />widget.fizz.fizz_buzzes.select { |fizz_buzz| <br /> fizz_buzz.widgets_column_name =~ /^special_.*/ <br />}.map { |fizz_buzz|<br /> widget.attribute_present?(fizz_buzz.widgets_column_name) &&<br />   { fizz_buzz.label => widget.send(fizz_buzz.widgets_column_name) } ||<br />   {}<br />}.inject({}, &:merge)</code></pre><br />While the details don&rsquo;t make much sense out of context, the overall pattern ought to be familiar as an example of the MapReduce pattern (without the distributed processing, of course).<br /><br />Pipelines read from right-to-left, left-to-right, or both. For example, this set of three nested function calls reads from right-to-left:<br /><pre><code><br />sum_numbers.call(square_numbers.call(odd_numbers.call(1..100)))</code></pre><br />If I try to read it from left-to-right, it&#8217;s sounds like a caricature of speech: &#8220;The sum of the squares of the odd numbers from one to one hundred.&#8221; You can&#8217;t figure it out unless you build an abstract syntax tree in your head and then evaluate it with a stack machine. Having to emulate a computer to figure out what something means is not a good sign.  it reads much easier from right-to-left: &#8220;Take the numbers from one to one hundred. Select the odd ones. Square them. And finally, take the sum.&#8221;<br /><br />Popular languages like Ruby make it easy to write expressions that read from left-to-right directly: here&#8217;s an example from Ruby 1.9 (or with Symbol#to_proc):<br /><pre><code><br />(1..100).select(&amp;:odd?).map { |n| n*n }.inject(&amp;:+)<br />    =&gt; 166650</code></pre><br />Object orientation&#8217;s emphasis on nouns at the expense of verbs has its issues. But when a computation really is a step-wise transformation of data, I find that chaining methods makes code a lot easier to understand than nesting functions. On the other hand, I prefer nesting functions when the expression has more of a tree form.<br /><br />But whichever direction you prefer, I find it very difficult to read code that mixes directions in the same expression:<br /><pre><code><br />square_elements = lambda { ... } # content elided<br />square_elements.call((1..100).select(&amp;:odd?)).inject(&amp;:+)</code></pre><br />You go left-to-right to select odd members, then back left to square them, then right to sum them. I find this much more confusing than either the nested functions or the chained method calls.<br /><br /><strong>Object#into</strong><br /><br />A little while ago, I saw John Carter define factorial in Ruby as a <a href="http://lambda-the-ultimate.org/node/1480#comment-17040" title="ruby vs python | Lambda the Ultimate">method</a> in the Integer class:<br /><pre><code><br />class Integer<br />  def factorial<br />    return 1 if self &lt;= 1<br />    self * (self-1).factorial<br />  end<br />end</code></pre><br />My first reaction was to think that adding factorial as a method was an idea from <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1594568545?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=raganwald001-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=1594568545" title="Chessmen of Mars">another planet</a>:<sup><font size="-2">1</font></sup> why should integers know how to answer their own factorials? This seemed like a classic case of <a href="http://raganwald.github.com/2007/10/too-much-of-good-thing-not-all.html" title="Too much of a good thing: not all functions should be object methods">a function that should not be an object method</a>. But nevertheless, having calculations be methods instead of functions lets you write a certain type of expression consistently from left-to-right (<code>5.succ.factorial.succ.odd</code>) instead of mixing directions (<code>factorial.call(5.succ).succ.odd?</code>).<br /><br />All the same, there are good reasons why we don&#8217;t overload numeric classes with every possible calculation and formula. So what can we do? How about:<br /><pre><code><br />class Object<br />    def into expr = nil<br />        expr.nil? ? yield(self) : expr.to_proc.call(self)<br />    end<br />end</code></pre><br />Now, snarfing <a href="http://www.eecs.harvard.edu/~cduan/technical/ruby/ycombinator.shtml" title="A Use of the Y Combinator in Ruby">Charles Duan&#8217;s code</a>, we can write:<br /><pre><code><br />y = proc { |generator|<br />    proc { |x|<br />        proc { |*args|<br />            generator.call(x.call(x)).call(*args)<br />        }<br />    }.call(proc { |x|<br />        proc { |*args|<br />            generator.call(x.call(x)).call(*args)<br />        }<br />    })<br />}<br /><br />factorial = y.call(proc { |callback|<br />    proc { |arg|<br />        if arg.zero?  then 1<br />        else          arg * callback.call(arg - 1)<br />        end<br />    }<br />})</code></pre><br />Which lets us write:<br /><pre><code><br />5.succ.into(factorial).succ.odd?<br />    =&gt; true</code></pre><br />I read this as &#8220;Start with five, get its successor, put that into the factorial proc, take the result&#8217;s successor, and answer whether it is odd.&#8221; The whole thing reads in one consistent style, you aren&#8217;t mixing left-to-right method chaining with right-to-left nesting functions. I wouldn&#8217;t go crazy with Object#into in a program, but if you have an expression that is predominately chaining methods, Object#into can make it consistent and improve its readability.<br /><br /><strong>Function Composition</strong><br /><br />There is more than one way to skin a cat. If <code>f(g(h(value)))</code> is too constricting, we can <a href="http://blog.moertel.com/articles/2006/04/07/composing-functions-in-ruby" title="Composing functions in Ruby">compose</a> functions instead of nesting them. So we can write:<br /><pre><code><br />class Proc<br />  def self.compose(f, g)<br />    lambda { |*args| f[g[*args]] }<br />  end<br />  def *(g) # Tom's origional composition operator<br />    Proc.compose(self, g)<br />  end<br />  def |(g) # The reverse composition operator, mimicing a pipe<br />    Proc.compose(g, self)<br />  end<br />end<br /><br />plus1 = lambda { |n| n + 1 }<br />squared = lambda { |n| n * n }<br />minus1 = lambda { |n| n - 1 }</code></pre><br />This allows us to write <code>(minus1 | squared | plus1).call(5)</code>, which puts <em>almost</em> everything in left-to-right order. Hey, remember Object#into? Why don&#8217;t we try it?<br /><pre><code><br />5.into(minus1 | squared | plus1)</code></pre><br />That saves us from writing <code>5.into(minus1).into(squared).into(plus1)</code> if we find three instances of &#8220;into&#8221; a little noisy. Composing functions using <code>*</code> lets us maintain right-to-left order and composing functions with <code>|</code> lets us create left-to-right order when we are making a &#8220;pipeline&#8221; of expressions.<br /><br /><strong>Summary</strong><br /><br />In the end, this is a very trivial idea: When an expression can be written so that it reads consistently from left-to-right or consistently from right-to-left, do so. The code will be easier to read.<br /><br /><hr><ol><li>Uh, yes, I am familiar with Smalltalk.

					<a href="http://raganwald.github.com/2008/01/finding-inspiration-in-midwifery.html" title="permanent link">Informed Choice</a></span>
					<div style="clear:both;"></div>I found some folks <a href="http://www.infoq.com/news/2008/01/developer-responsibility" title="An Agile Developer's Responsibility">arguing about whether developers should write messy code</a>. Having observed our <a href="http://chic.oise.utoronto.ca/~jmcguire/sgmtbkup/" title="Seventh Generation Midwives Toronto">amazing midwives</a> &#8220;deliver&#8221; for the second time, I believe it is often an issue of <em>Informed Choice</em>.<br /><br />Presuming that the client or stake holder bears the entire &#8220;cost&#8221; of the decision, they deserve the last word. I know more than a few people who argue with this, saying that writing clean code is in the client&#8217;s best interests. Well yes, of course it is. And in my experience, so are a number of other practices such as managing a project using <a href="http://raganwald.github.com/2007/06/which-theory-first-evidence.html" title="Which theory fits the evidence?">Theory P</a>, <a href="http://raganwald.github.com/2007/11/what-if-powerful-languages-and-idioms.html" title="What if powerful languages and idioms only work for small teams?">using small teams</a>, and <a href="http://raganwald.github.com/2007/05/not-so-big-software-application.html" title="The Not So Big Software Design">customizing a design for the specific project</a>. But let&#8217;s make this really simple: the client is asking for something which&#8212;in your professional opinion&#8212;is not in their <em>best</em> interests but also is not so ruinously bad that the entire project will absolutely, positively fail.<br /><br />There can be a set of options that are all somewhat reasonable, with some better or much better than others, but none being outright wrong. In midwifery, there is a choice between giving birth in the hospital or at home. There is a choice between having an epidural or going natural. There are choices about what to administer to the newborn as a prophylactic against infection. The mother makes an informed decision on each of these subjects with the assistance of the midwife, and the midwife supports here even if it is a decision that the midwife feels is statistically less than optimum.<br /><br />In software development, a client may wish to design everything up front. I believe with all of my heart this is not the <em>best</em> way to go, but let me tell you: I have managed projects on this basis and succeeded. I think I have done a better job managing projects another way, but I can&#8217;t tell you that a project absolutely has to fail if you start this way. Likewise large teams deliver software, and some of the things I have built have had a very high buzzword-to-value ratio.<br /><br />I would argue against these practices in many cases, but if the client is fully informed of the possible outcomes, they must be permitted to control their own destiny.<br /><br /><div class="book"><hr/><em><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0805082115?ie=UTF8&tag=raganwald001-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0805082115"><img border="0" src="http://raganwald.github.com/uploaded_images/better.jpg"></a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=raganwald001-20&l=as2&o=1&a=0805082115" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" /><br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0805082115?ie=UTF8&tag=raganwald001-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0805082115">Better: A Surgeon's Notes on Performance</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=raganwald001-20&l=as2&o=1&a=0805082115" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" /> is a terrific book, especially for software developers. Issues of efficiency, <a title="What I admire about professions like Engineering and Medicine" href="http://raganwald.github.com/2008/01/what-i-admire-about-professions-like.html">ethics</a>, and improving personal performance are all critical to software professionals. &ldquo;Better&rdquo; addresses them with insights that forced me to re-examine some of my own ideas and practices. Highly recommended.<br /></em><hr/></div>I know there&#8217;s a grey area here. If you believe the client wants things so messy and so unhygienic that you don&#8217;t have confidence in the project, I will support your decision to say <em>no</em> to the client. I applaud that. But if it&#8217;s in that grey area where we are arguing the difference between good and mediocre but serviceable from the client&#8217;s perspective, I believe that my responsibility is to provide clients with the information they need to make the decision.<br /><br />So for example, if they demand BDUF, I have to tell them how I think the project will <em>actually</em> go if we walk that line. I need them to &#8220;sign a consent form&#8221; explaining that they understand the risk that we will deliver something that will meet the written requirements but will not meet their updated, educated requirements once the project is underway. They must be clear on the fact that this choice will be a loss for them if and when they realize that the origional direction was imperfect. I need them looking me straight in the eye and saying &#8220;I understand what you are saying, but I am willing to take that chance.&#8221;<br /><br />If they argue with me and tell me I&#8217;m wrong, that BDUF is always better than iterative, then I know that I am not the right man for them. I know that they are not making an informed choice. And likewise, if asked to do something quick and dirty, I will say &#8220;no&#8221; if the client tells me they believe it is the best way. But if they understand technical debt, if they know they are making a trade off of now versus later, who am I to reach into their pocket and spend their money as <em>I</em> see fit?<br /><br />Our midwives know much more about giving birth than we did. And they advised us accordingly. But we bore the responsibility for certain decisions, and they ceded those decisions to us, even when they had strong opinions about what was the best thing to do. I think as a software developer I must follow the same path. A midwife will not allow a client to perform a home <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesarean_section">Caesarian section</a>. There <em>are</em> limits, there are things we know mean instant and irrevocable failure. But where judgment is required, where there is a decision between mediocre, good, and better outcomes, they advise and then allow the client to make the final say.<br /><br />I believe we in software must follow the same path.<div style="clear:both; padding-bottom:0.25em"></div>&nbsp;

					<div style="clear:both;"></div>Someone raised the question of whether it was appropriate to use the pronoun &ldquo;she&rdquo; in <a title="Billy Martin's Technique for Managing his Manager" href="http://raganwald.github.com/2008/01/billy-martins-technique-for-managing.html">a recent anecdote about envelopes</a>. The question included some irrelevant anti-diversity ranting, but the part that was worth consideration questioned whether the <em>generic personal pronoun</em> should be &ldquo;he&rdquo; or &ldquo;she.&rdquo;<br /><br />The rule in English is clear: if the person is of unknown gender, use <em>he</em>. For example:<br /><br /><blockquote>The rule is that when a writer makes a statement about an unknown person, he should use &ldquo;he.&rdquo; He should not use &ldquo;she&rdquo; unless he is making a statement about a person who is female.</blockquote><br />Therefore, if I am writing about an unknown person and I use the word &ldquo;he,&rdquo; I am not asserting that the person is male. It isn&rsquo;t even the masculine pronoun in this context.<br /><br />However, that has <em>nothing</em> to do with the anecdote. The reason why it has nothing to do with the anecdote is that the anecdote was not about an unknown person. It was about a fictitious person who was female.<br /><br /><blockquote>Once upon a time there was an author who was trying to decide which pronoun to use. She was told that when she was making a statement about an unknown person, she should use &ldquo;he.&rdquo; She was told that she should not use &ldquo;she&rdquo; unless she was making a statement about a person who was female.</blockquote> <br />In this example, I am not talking about an unknown author, I am asking you to consider one specific fictitious author whom I have decided is female. There is no debate about that: I am entitled to write about women, Canadians, Scots, and anyone else I fancy.<br /><br />There is a question as to whether the manager&rsquo;s gender is relevant. Including details like this helps you see in your mind&rsquo;s eye the person I saw when I wrote it. It is not obvious whether this improves the anecdote or whether the anecdote would be better if the gender was omitted.<br /><br />But I think it is an appropriate use of the word &ldquo;she,&rdquo; and I stand by its use in the anecdote.<br /><br /><em>Update</em>: The difference between a specific pronoun and a generic pronoun is clear when you contrast the story about a fictitious manager with this sentence from <a href="http://raganwald.github.com/2008/01/whatever-happened-to-code-reviews.html" rel="nofollow">Whatever happened to code reviews?</a>:<br /><br /><blockquote>If someone writes code in that language, they are absolved from all responsibility for its style. And so is their manager: the programmer&rsquo;s code compiled, it is demonstrably free of bad style, what can we demand of their manager other than to see to it that they use the language?</blockquote><br />In that post, I used <em>they are</em> instead of <em>he is</em>, and perhaps this is wrong, but this is unmistakably generic: I am not making a statement about some programmer, I am making a statement about all programmers who use a certain type of programming language. This is very different.<br /><br />Elsewhere, Kate Rhodes bought up the point that choosing to depict women in programming stories encourages women to enter the profession. This may be true, but I confess it is not why I do it from time to time. In actual fact, I know a number of very capable women who manage software development, so when I sometimes choose to write about a fictitious man and I sometimes choose to write about a fictitious woman, I am simply reflecting my own experience.<br /><br />If your experience does not resemble mine, that is good: what is the point of reading if not to discover new things?<div style="clear:both; padding-bottom:0.25em"></div>&nbsp;

					<div style="clear:both;"></div>I have read an argument that a programming language can enforce good programming style by restricting programmers to constructions and mechanisms that are deemed worthy, or perhaps are restricted to a small set so that there is an enforced consistency in a code base. (I am not talking about using compilers to detect bugs or memory management being used to prevent bugs, I am talking about programming languages that do not permit certain kinds of abstractions outright).<br /><br />The premise of the argument is that if programmers are constrained to a single, universal &#8220;good style,&#8221; good programs will result.<br /><br /><strong>responsibility and authority cannot be decoupled from each other</strong><br /><br />In many other forms of management, people have attempted to automate the manager out of a job. There is an idealistic notion that if we write just the right series of instructions for people, if we build the perfect instruction manual, if we detail every possible case and script every possible behaviour, we can build a team that always does the right thing. We see that in highly industrialized occupations like preparing fast food: there is a detailed, step-by-step instruction for everything, and employees simply follow the rules.<br /><br />Many things have been written about whether that works or doesn&#8217;t work for software developers. I am now talking about why that doesn&#8217;t work for teams, for team leaders, and for development managers. Every thing you put in place in an attempt to enforce good behaviour takes something away from the team&#8217;s responsibility to manage the process using judgement.<br /><br /><strong>a false sense of security</strong><br /><br />We joke about a compiler generating a false sense of security: it compiles, so it must work. But that is <em>exactly</em> the mind set of choosing a language on the basis of it actively preventing poor style: we are choosing it because it will relieve us of the work of manually reviewing code and analysing whether it is of good style or not. It will relieve us of the work of setting a good example and evangelizing good code. It will relieve us of the work of teaching, of leading, or managing.<br /><br />In the fast food example, we know that the &#8220;managers&#8221; in the restaurants are not true managers. They have little or no authority to deviate from the rules. And for that reason, they have little or no accountability for what results: you can fire them for failing to follow the rules, but if they follow the rules and bad things happen, it is the rules that are at fault, not the manager.<br /><br />And so it is with enforcing &#8220;good style&#8221; with a programming language. If someone writes code in that language, they are absolved from all responsibility for its style. And so is their manager: the programmer&rsquo;s code compiled, it is demonstrably free of bad style, what can we demand of their manager other than to see to it that they use the language?<br /><br />Software development is a young profession. We don&rsquo;t know an awful lot about what works and what doesn&rsquo;t work. but I&rsquo;ll take a stand here: We humans have an awful lot of experience with the relationship between authority and responsibility. And what we have learned is that if we remove an individual&rsquo;s authority to choose, we absolve them of responsibility for the result, and ultimately performance suffers greatly even if their skills are objectively high.<br /><br /><strong>automatons on the style council</strong><br /><br />Does this mean that automation is bad? Why do we use high level languages and compilers? Why do we use libraries and frameworks? Don&rsquo;t those tools also relieve us of responsibility?<br /><br /><div class="book"><em><hr/><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0735619670?ie=UTF8&tag=raganwald001-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0735619670"><img border="0" src="http://raganwald.github.com/uploaded_images/code_complete.jpg"></a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=raganwald001-20&l=as2&o=1&a=0735619670" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" /><br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0735619670?ie=UTF8&tag=raganwald001-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0735619670">Code Complete</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=raganwald001-20&l=as2&o=1&a=0735619670" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" /> is one of the greatest books ever written on the subject of shipping software.

The wisdom about code style, quality, and review will pay for the book many times over.<br /><hr/></em></div>Well yes, of course they do. <em>They relive us of responsibility for things we have deemed not to matter</em>. For the vast majority of lines of code, the exact translation to CPU op codes is unimportant, as long as it works. Nobody cares to look under the hood. Compilation is the process of automating the accidental complexity of our CPU.<br /><br />If you choose to use a programming language with lazy evaluation, you have decided that evaluation order is an accidental complexity that no longer matters to you, and you want the language to sweep it out of sight. What we choose to automate speaks to what we consider irrelevant. As long as it works, we don&rsquo;t care how it&rsquo;s done.<br /><br />So when we automate style, we are deciding that style dosn&rsquo;t matter. As long as it passes the compiler, it is good style.<sup><font size="1">1</font></sup><br /><br />Automating good style ultimately weakens the notion of individual and shared code ownership, it emphasizes the notion that if it passes the gate, it must be good. That, in turn, creates the illusion that no further inspection is required. If it functions as we require, and it is written in the language that enforces good style, why do we need to review it?<br /><br />We can talk about why role of a programming language should be to <em>enable good style</em>, and have a terrific debate about what that means and which languages do a good job with it. But it is more important to keep our eye on the ball. The most important factor for the success of software projects is still the people. And what makes people produce good software? Taking responsibility for their work. Ownership and accountability.<br /><br />Ownership and accountability is weakened when you attempt to constrain the programmer and it is enhanced when you provide a programmer with freedom and follow up with review. Thus, my question:<br /><br />Whatever happened to code reviews?<br /><br /><hr/><br /><ol><li>Python&rsquo;s significant whitespace is a good example of this. By enforcing a standard indentation, Python says that indentation isn&rsquo;t worth thinking about: everybody does it one way, and that&rsquo;s a benefit for readability. Compare and contrast this to a hypothetical language <i>Imperitivity</i>. <i>Imperitivity</i> does not have anonymous functions or closures as first-class objects, and many <i>Imperitivity</i> programmers argue that they should not be added to the language because that would be bad style, or it would promote inconsistent style with some people using closures and some not.<br /><br />Would we seriously equate the two positions? I think not: whitespace really is pretty trivial: the fact that we can write a script or IDE plug-in to &ldquo;fix&rdquo; indentation to match a style guide is evidence that it should not take up valuable team and management attention.<br /><br />However, the question of whether a code base should include closures, should not include closures, or ought to enforce a consistent approach to closures is important. Using a language to settle the question is an abrogation of responsibility: the matter should be decide by the team or technical leadership and enforced through review, mentoring, training, example code, and so forth.<br /><br />The salient difference is that while consistent indentation is useful, indentation itself is unimportant in comparison to other technical choices the team must make. Important choices, such as the appropriate paradigms or idioms to use, ought to be decided by the team and enforced through review.</li></ol><div style="clear:both; padding-bottom:0.25em"></div>&nbsp;

					<div style="clear:both;"></div>A software manager is brought into a doomed project. It is hopelessly behind, the requirements have changed so often they are now kept on a white board instead of in a document, and the office is wallpapered with Dilbert cartoons. She&#8217;s replacing the previous manager, who has resigned.<br /><br />When she gets to her new office, her predecessor is clearing out her desk. &#8220;I&#8217;ll only be a minute. By the way, I left you something&#8221; says the old manager before leaving. After the predecessor leaves, the new manager has a look around, and discovers two envelopes in the top drawer of the desk. The first envelope is labeled &#8220;Open when in trouble.&#8221; The second is labeled &#8220;Open when in even more trouble.&#8221;<br /><br />Well, she researches <a title="What I've learned from failure" href="http://raganwald.github.com/2005/01/what-ive-learned-from-failure.html">anti-patterns in software project management</a>, has a look around, talks to everyone, identifies the key players, and goes to management with a clear explanation of what the problems are, what&#8217;s realistic to achieve, and what needs to be done. To her surprise, management seems to go along with things and tells her to make whatever changes she needs. She institutes daily builds, stand up meetings, rapid iterations, and starts tracking velocity. Two months later, at the quarterly review, she presents her progress. The team is producing at 200% of the previous rate, morale is up, and they&#8217;re going to get 80% of the previous functionality done with less than 90 days of slip off the impossible schedule.<br /><br />There is silence, then management tells her that this is <em>unacceptable</em>. Sure, they agreed she could institute change. That&#8217;s her job. However they did not approve any compromise in scope or delivery date. This is a competitive business, and there are thousands of qualified managers looking for a job who can come in and get things done. Does she want to admit she can&#8217;t do her job?<br /><br /><blockquote>We have assigned a product manager to discuss IBM WebSphere Portal integration with your technical lead. And the VP of Marketing needs to talk to you. We have made a commitment to all-singing, all-dancing web services and he needs a forty-minute presentation explaining how your project will be implemented with web services throughout. You look pale. Is there a problem?</blockquote><br />She goes back to her office in a quandary, then remembers the first envelope. Wordlessly, she opens it, and inside there is a three by five card inscribed: <em>Blame Me</em>.<br /><br />She goes back to management a day later with a powerpoint emphasizing how the project was way off track, how the architecture was fubar, how morale was poor, and how requirements were incorrectly documented. She doesn&#8217;t blame the previous manager directly, but she does identify various management techniques and &#8220;best practices&#8221; that were not enforced prior to her joining the project. She says she will work the team to hit the date, but she demonstrates how commitments made by  the previous manager were done without actually checking to see whether the team could deliver or making any changes to actually hit the new dates. After some huffing and puffing, management buys off on delivering 80% of the promised functionality with a 45 day slip in the delivery date. Whew!<br /><br />Well, things go along quite well until two weeks before the original due date. Management calls her in and asks her to sit on the release planning board, there will be a major customer release in two weeks. She reminds them of the 45 day slip they negotiated.<br /><br />&#8220;No,&#8221; they tell her baldly, &#8220;We agreed on delivering 80% of the functionality on the original date and the remaining 20% of the functionality 45 days later in release 1.1. Furthermore, we are entering into a strategic agreement with IBM and have assigned a product manager to discuss IBM WebSphere Portal integration with your technical lead. And the VP of Marketing needs to talk to you. We have made a strategic corporate commitment to all-singing, all-dancing web services and he needs a forty-minute presentation explaining how your project will be implemented with web services throughout. You look pale. Is there a problem?&#8221; She leaves the meeting aghast.<br /><br />Well, it&#8217;s back to her office and she opens the second envelope with shaking hands. The advice on the card is of little comfort: <a href="http://rot13.com/index.php?text=Cercner%20gjb%20rairybcrf" title="rot13.com">Cercner gjb rairybcrf</a>.<br /><br /><em>This story is often told about baseball manager Billy Martin.

I don&rsquo;t like to use that word, because it suggests that the job itself is a luxury. It is possible that the pay cheque is a luxury, but for people who are engaged in their careers, the job is a necessity because their self-actualization depends on doing a good job.

					<a href="http://raganwald.github.com/2008/01/word-intuitive-isnt.html" title="permanent link">The word "intuitive"... isn't.</a></span>
					<div style="clear:both;"></div>First off, thanks to everyone who <a href="http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7618424&amp;postID=3737446643639700029" title="Comments on 'A programming language cannot be better without being unintuitive'">wrote</a> in with different interpretations of what the word &#8220;intuitive&#8221; really means. I agree that Jef Raskin did not have the final say.<br /><br />Intuitive does not only mean <em>familiar</em>. It can also mean consistent, stable, discoverable, and exhibiting affordances. And some other things. The reason it means different things is that &#8220;intuitive&#8221; is not a concrete or objective property of software. It is the <em>result</em> of a good combination of objective properties. &#8220;Intuitive&#8221; is the result of good design, not the cause.<br /><br />And this is why it is not a very helpful word. Like good design, it means different things to different people. So saying that such-and-such a programming language is &#8220;intuitive&#8221; is far less meaningful than saying it is consistent, or stable, or discoverable, or &ldquo;familiar to C++ programmers.&rdquo; Intuitive is a word people use to describe their subjective impression of whether something is well designed. Someone can always argue with the word &#8220;intuitive,&#8221; but we can all agree on objective characteristics like whether Java or PHP are consistent. Or we can compare the intellectual surface area of Haskell to Ruby.<br /><br />So on to why <a href="http://raganwald.github.com/2008/01/programming-language-cannot-be-better.html">a programming language cannot be better without being unintuitive</a>:<br /><br />All programming languages are equally powerful. So what does it mean to be &#8220;better&#8221;? Better is a subjective word, a result, just like intuitive. The sentence is consistent, because it compares two subjective things to each other. And obviously it makes a lot of sense if you accept Raskin&#8217;s rather narrow explanation that intuitive equals familiar. (Although narrow, it fits my experience when talking about how non-professionals view end-user software: In a recent project, clients were still claiming that search boxes for each field in a table were more &#8220;intuitive&#8221; than a single full-text search. Naturally, these were older managers who had spent their formative years working with ASCII applications that worked on that principle.)<br /><br />So for the narrow explanation that intuitive springs from familiarity, a language cannot be better without being unfamiliar. Well, how can it be &#8220;better&#8221; if they&#8217;re all Turing Equivalent? Only in a subjective way; only by making <em>you</em> better. And in that sense, a language is only better if the process of using it makes you better as a programmer. Which comes from being <a href="http://raganwald.github.com/2007/02/but-y-would-i-want-to-do-thing-like.html" title="But Y would I want to do a thing like this?">moved out of your comfort zone</a> and into a place where you must learn, and where the things you learn are productive.<br /><br />Not rote memorization of when to use .length, .length(), .size(), or .getLength(). But rather when you learn new ways of thinking about the problem to be solved. Not every unfamiliar language is better, but every better language is unfamiliar.<br /><br />Now what about the other ways you can arrive at software that feels &#8220;intuitive&#8221;? What about a language that is unfamiliar but consistent, stable, and discoverable? Won&#8217;t it be better? Well, yes, of course. In fact, it will be a <em>better better</em> than one that isn&#8217;t. You will learn more from functional programming in Haskell than functional programming in Ruby.<br /><br />But what if a language was familiar but improved on what you already use by being more discoverable, more consistent, more stable, and so forth? How much better could it really be? In the sense of improving you as a programmer, how much personal value can we extract from a language that improves upon the familiar while still being familiar? Raskin suggests we will obtain at best minor improvements. Is Java really only a little better than C++, if at all? In the sense of making you a better programmer, what does Java teach you if you are already a competent C++ programmer?<br /><br />(Of course, a straw man interlocutor can ask, &ldquo;But what if I don&rsquo;t already know C++? Isn&rsquo;t Java a better language for me to learn first?&rdquo; Ys, it may be a little better to learn. Perhaps. But in that case, the premise of the post is assured since <em>neither</em> language is familiar to the beginner.)<br /><br />Unfamiliarity is the driving force behind being better in the sense of a programming language. And &ldquo;intuitive&rdquo; isn&rsquo;t a real property of programming languages, it&rsquo;s the result of good design.<div style="clear:both; padding-bottom:0.25em"></div>&nbsp;

					<div style="clear:both;"></div><blockquote>Optimising your notation to not confuse people in the first 10 minutes of seeing it but to hinder readability ever after is a really bad mistake.</blockquote><div>&mdash;David MacIver, via <a href="http://rickyclarkson.blogspot.com/2008/01/in-defence-of-0l-in-scala.html">In Defence of (0/:l)(_+_) in Scala</a></div><br />Or as Jef Raskin put it:<br /><br /><blockquote>The impression that the phrase &#8220;this interface feature is intuitive&#8221; leaves is that the interface works the way the user does, that normal human &#8220;intuition&#8221; suffices to use it, that neither training nor rational thought is necessary, and that it will feel &#8220;natural.&#8221; We are said to &#8220;intuit&#8221; a concept when we seem to suddenly understand it without any apparent effort or previous exposure to the idea.<br />  <br />It is clear that a user interface feature is &#8220;intuitive&#8221; insofar as it resembles or is identical to something the user has already learned. In short, &#8220;intuitive&#8221; in this context is an almost exact synonym of &#8220;familiar.&#8221;<br />  <br />The term &#8220;intuitive&#8221; is associated with approval when applied to an interface, but this association and the magazines’ rating systems raise the issue of the tension between improvement and familiarity. As an interface designer I am often asked to design a &#8220;better&#8221; interface to some product. Usually one can be designed such that, in terms of learning time, eventual speed of operation (productivity), decreased error rates, and ease of implementation it is superior to competing or the client’s own products. Even where my proposals are seen as significant improvements, they are often rejected nonetheless on the grounds that they are not intuitive.<br /><br />It is a classic &#8220;catch 22.&#8221; The client wants something that is significantly superior to the competition. But if superior, it cannot be the same, so it must be different (typically the greater the improvement, the greater the difference). Therefore it cannot be intuitive, that is, familiar. What the client usually wants is an interface with at most marginal differences that, somehow, makes a major improvement. This can be achieved only on the rare occasions where the original interface has some major flaw that is remedied by a minor fix.</blockquote><div>&mdash;Jef Raskin, <a href="http://www.asktog.com/papers/raskinintuit.html">Intuitive Equals Familiar</a></div><br /><br />Complaining that a programming language &ldquo;Violates the Principle of Least Surprise&rdquo; is a complaint that it fails to appeal at first glance, without any training or investigation. But if a new language is &ldquo;intuitive,&rdquo; it can only offer you a marginal improvement over the languages you already know well.<br /><br />You needn&rsquo;t look at functional langauges like Scala to see this at work. Is Ruby&rsquo;s for loop an improvement over Java? By how much? Ruby&rsquo;s big win over Java in that regard is the ease with which you can use <a title="An Introduction to Ruby's Enumerable Module" href="http://jamesgolick.com/2008/1/6/an-introduction-to-ruby-s-enumerable-module">Enumerable&rsquo;s collect, select, detect, and inject methods</a>. Which, of course, are not <em>familiar</em> to the programmer with a grounding in for loops. They require study to understand. But once understood, they make code easier to read thereafter.<br /><br /><hr/><br /><em>post scriptum</em>:<br /><br />As Justin points out in the comments, the real meaning of the &ldquo;Principle of Least Surprise&rdquo; is that languages should be <em>consistent</em>. The principle applies to how the language behaves when you already know something about it. So if you see <code>(_+_)</code>, the questions is whether this makes sense if you already know that underscore is a function parameter.<br /><br /><em>And more</em>: <a href="http://raganwald.github.com/2008/01/word-intuitive-isnt.html">The word "intuitive"... isn't.</a><br /><br /><em>And even more, from Matz in Japanese</em>: <a href="http://www.rubyist.net/~matz/20080108.html#p02">http://www.rubyist.net/~matz/20080108.html#p02</a><div style="clear:both; padding-bottom:0.25em"></div>&nbsp;

					<a href="http://raganwald.github.com/2008/01/problem-with-problem-with-design.html" title="permanent link">Another problem with problems with design patterns</a></span>
					<div style="clear:both;"></div><blockquote>The documentation for a design pattern describes the context in which the pattern is used, the forces within the context that the pattern seeks to resolve, and the suggested solution. [For example:] The visitor design pattern is a way of separating an algorithm from an object structure. A practical result of this separation is the ability to add new operations to existing object structures without modifying those structures.</blockquote><br />I have read the view that design patterns represent deficiencies in a programming language. This argument stems from the observation that the specific code examples for half or more of the patterns in the GoF Book are "superfluous" in languages that provide abstractions above and beyond basic OO. The Visitor pattern can be said (depending on which Golden Hammer you are holding) to represent a way to brew your own multiple dispatch, open classes, or pattern matching.<br /><br /><blockquote>Fools ignore complexity. Pragmatists suffer it. Some can avoid it. Geniuses remove it.</blockquote><br />Does this mean that given a sufficiently expressive language there will be no design patterns? Certainly not. Each design pattern organizes a problem and <em>one</em> suggested solution in a structured way, giving the solution a name so that programmers may enjoy a common vocabulary. The pattern would only go away if the problem goes away.<br /><br />But why would a more expressive language have this better feature, if not to solve the problem? Clearly the problem doesn&#8217;t go away, it is just that instead of writing our own incomplete and buggy mechanisms for multiple dispatch we can now use the language&#8217;s complete, tested, and &#8220;free&#8221; multiple dispatch feature to solve the problem.<br /><br />If you consider the problem to be &#8220;How do I implement my own multiple dispatch,&#8221; then the Visitor pattern is obsolete if you are using a language like Common Lisp. However, if you consider the problem to be &#8220;How do I separate algorithms from data structures,&#8221; then the only thing obsolete in the originally publicized pattern are the language-specific details. The high-level approach can still be relevant.<br /><br /><blockquote>A programming language is low level when its programs require attention to the irrelevant.</blockquote><br />Some programming languages accomplish the same task with a declaration or a singe line of code. From this, some draw the conclusion that design patterns exist because popular programming languages lack certain abstractions or they lack the meta-abstractions permitting you to build your own abstractions cleanly. The underlying assumption here is that the purpose of the pattern is to explain specifically how to write the code.<br /><br />This is clearly not the case. The Ruby language implements the Singleton pattern with a single abstraction, the Singleton module. <code>include Singleton</code> is all you need to implement the pattern. Yet, would we say that in Ruby there are no Singletons? No, we would say that Ruby makes them easy.<br /><br /><blockquote>I always felt the beauty of Java was that there is only one &#8216;standard&#8217; way of handling most problems. I know it might not be &#8216;fun&#8217;, &#8216;smart&#8217; or &#8216;elegant&#8217; in most people&#8217;s views, but most software factories don&#8217;t want people to write elegant code. They want standardized maintainable stuff that people can understand ten years from now because it&#8217;s written in the same fashion [as] everything else out there&#8230;<br />  <br />I really think that great code is easy to understand and follows patterns that people are used to and comfortable with&#8230; I read someone&#8217;s code I just want to be able to understand it as quickly as possible, find the spot where the changes go and be able to figure out how said changes should fit in the general design.</blockquote><div>&#8212;inopia <a href="http://programming.reddit.com/info/63nkp/comments/c02q9d2">commenting</a> on <a href="http://raganwald.github.com/2007/12/newly-discovered-design-pattern-code.html">Newly Discovered Design Pattern: &#8220;Code Well.&#8221;</a> Reposted with permission.</div><br />One argument is that implementing code a certain way is what makes it easy to read, what makes it <em>familiar</em>.

Anyone who has an interest in making their house or apartment a deeply satisfying, functional home needs to read this book once in their lives. If you don&rsquo;t have the budget to buy it today, I urge you to borrow it from a friend or from your library.<br /><br />And of course, you can learn a great deal about software design from it. In many ways, you can learn much more about how to think about design than from software patterns books. One thing that stands out is that this is a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0195024028?ie=UTF8&tag=raganwald001-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0195024028">Timeless Way of Building</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=raganwald001-20&l=as2&o=1&a=0195024028" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />. When you see how these patterns transcend specific construction materials and methods, you the common forces in software design that transcend tools.<hr/></em></div>Even if the exact implementation of a pattern is abbreviated or even trivial in another language, patterns still provide the identification of the context, forces, and resolution with a common name everyone can understand.<br /><br />A programming language <em>can</em> make some patterns go away. But not by providing features and abstractions that eliminate the repetitive boilerplate. Such languages make the patterns succinct, elegant, and remarkably easy to read&hellip; but not superfluous.<br /><br />Instead, a language can make the patterns go away by introducing entirely different contexts for designing programs. To stretch the building metaphor, patterns of home design go away if you are designing a commune instead of separate family dwellings. It is not a question of how one builds homes, we do away with homes altogether.<br /><br />Radically different paradigms for programming can eliminate the patterns we know. For example, if you are building a Common Lisp program with objects and use multiple dispatch, you are still thinking in objects and thus you wrestle with the same forces upon them.<br /><br />But if you build a Common Lisp program in a functional way, you may be able to get by without any objects at all, not even objects you have faked using closures. In that case, you don&rsquo;t need the OO patterns because you aren&rsquo;t in an OO context.<br /><br />But that being said, there are <em>other</em> patterns you need that suit a functional programming context like <span style="font-style:italic;">Iterator</span> and <span style="font-style:italic;">Idiomatic Traversal</span>. It is not a case of Common Lisp being so powerful that no patterns are needed, it is a case of Common Lisp providing the power to make certain patterns elegant and simple should you choose to program in a manner that can make use of them.<br /><br />So languages can make patterns go away by introducing entirely new paradigms. And those paradigms will have their own patterns appropriate for resolving their forces.<br /><br />In summary, I dispute that design patterns represent language flaws. I claim that while the specific suggested implementations may work around language flaws, the context, forces, and resolution are relevant and valuable as long as you are working within the same paradigm.<br /><br /><blockquote>Get into a rut early: Do the same process the same way. Accumulate idioms. Standardize. The only difference(!) between Shakespeare and you was the size of his idiom list&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;not the size of his vocabulary.</blockquote><br /><br /><hr/><br />All quotes from Wikipedia or from Alan J. Perlis&rsquo; <a href="http://www.cs.yale.edu/quotes.html">Epigrams in Programming</a> unless otherwise attributed.<br /><br /><em>post scriptum</em>:<br /><br />I notice that the first couple of comments that appeared on a popular link aggregation site disagreed with my perspective that design patterns are much more than the language-specific implementation. To them, a Singleton in Ruby is a library call, not a pattern.<br /><br />Patterns have four elements. The argument seems to be that three of the four elements&mdash;name, context, forces to be resolved&mdash;belong to a &ldquo;Concept,&rdquo; and only the fourth&mdash;the one we don&rsquo;t like&mdash;is a pattern.<br /><br />Upon reflection, what I find most interesting about this perspective is how much it has in common with the pattern abuse that I have criticized in the past: an obsession with the surface form. I wrote about that above:<br /><br /><blockquote>This line of thinking is grounded in the idea that the valuable part of the patterns is the suggested solution at a detailed level.</blockquote><br />This criticism of patterns is rooted in exactly the same view of patterns: that he most important thing is the exact suggested solution, not the name, not the approach, not the context, not the forces to resolve. One person holds that up as a pattern&rsquo;s value, another criticizes it, but they are much more similar than different in their views.<div style="clear:both; padding-bottom:0.25em"></div>&nbsp;
